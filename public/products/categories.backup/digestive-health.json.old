The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSergel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sergel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sergel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sergel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sergel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sergel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sergel.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sergel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sergel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sergel include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sergel does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sergel capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sergel capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sergel.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sergel in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sergel is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sergel at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sergel. No specific antidote for Sergel is known. Since Sergel is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\rCommon Questions about Sergel 20 mg Capsule\rWhat is Sergel 20 mg Capsule?\rSergel 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus that persists longer than 24 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rBenign gastric ulcer: 40 mg daily in the morning for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20-40 mg daily in the morning for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed; maintenance dose is 20 mg daily, which may be increased to 40 mg daily.\rDuodenal ulcer: 40 mg daily in the morning for 2 weeks, continued for further 2 weeks if not fully healed.\rDuodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori: Pantoprazole is recommended at a dose of 40 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxycillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice daily for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice daily for one week.\rProphylaxis of NSAID-associated gastric or duodenal ulcer: 20 mg daily for those require long-term NSAID treatment.\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: Initially 80 mg once daily adjusted according to response (elderly max. 40 mg daily); daily doses above 80 mg given in 2 divided doses.\r IV Injection:\rDuodenal ulcer and gastric ulcer: 40 mg once daily for 7-10 days\rGastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis: 40 mg once daily for 7-10 days\rPrevention of rebleeding in peptic ulcer: IV 80 mg, followed by 8 mg/hour infusion for 72 hours\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 80 mg IV every 12 h for 24 h, followed by 40mg every 12 hour\rLong-term management of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome and other pathological hypersecretory conditions: 80 mg IV every 12 hours, may increase to 80 mg every 8 hours if needed, may titrate to higher doses depending on acid output.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions have been observed in clinical studies.\rContraindications\rPantoprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rPantonix is well tolerated in both short-term and long-term treatment. Headache and diarrhea are the common side effects and rarely included side effects are abdominal pain, flatulence, rash, insomnia and hyperglycemia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA Pregnancy Category of Pantoprazole is B. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pantoprazole has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be cautioned that Pantonix tablet should not be split, chewed or crushed. Long-term therapy of Pantonix may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) or may increase the risk of osteoporosis related disorders.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no known symptoms of overdosage in humans. Since Pantonix is highly protein bound, it is not readily dialyzable. Apart from symptomatic and supportive management, no specific therapy is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rReconstitution\rDirection for use of IV injection: Pantonix lyophilized powder and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Seclo treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Seclo is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Seclo 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Seclo 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Seclo and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Seclo is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Seclo and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rSeclo is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Seclo as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Seclo. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Seclo treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Seclo is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Seclo 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Seclo 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Seclo and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Seclo is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Seclo and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\r\nContraindications\r\nOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSeclo is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r\n \nUse in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Seclo as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Seclo. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMaxpro is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Maxpro may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxpro include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxpro does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Maxpro capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxpro capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxpro.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxpro in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxpro is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Maxpro at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxpro. No specific antidote for Maxpro is known. Since Maxpro is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Maxpro may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxpro include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxpro does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Maxpro capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxpro capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxpro.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxpro in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxpro is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Maxpro at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxpro. No specific antidote for Maxpro is known. Since Maxpro is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Finix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Finix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Finix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Finix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Finix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Finix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Finix is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Finix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Finix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Finix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Finix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Finix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Finix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Finix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Concomitant use of nitrates with tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may cause high blood pressure. Concomitant use of nitrates with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil cause fall in blood pressure. Aspirin decreases the clearance and enhances the hemodynamic effects of Nidocard Retard. Nidocard Retard may reduce the pharmacologic effects of heparin when used concomitantly. Nitrates increase the bioavailability of dihydroergotamine.\rContraindications\rNitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin, other organic nitrates, or nitrites or to the excipients of the medicine. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, marked anaemia, head trauma, cerebral haemorrhage, or closed angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rHeadache may occur at the onset of treatment but will usually subside after a few days. If the headache persists dosage should be decreased. Other side effects include tachycardia, postural hypotension and syncope, cyanosis and methaemoglobinaemia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no evidence relating to the safety of nitrates in pregnancy and lactation. Nitroglycerin should be administered to pregnant women and nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNidocard Retard should be used with caution in patients who are predisposed to closed-angle glaucoma. As with other drugs for the treatment of angina pectoris, abrupt discontinuation of therapy may lead to exacerbation of symptoms. When discontinuing long term treatment, the dosage should be reduced gradually over several days, and the patient carefully monitored. The use of Nidocard Retard during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to hemodynamic monitoring and clinical status to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.\rOverdose Effects\rln the case of overdosage, the likely symptomatology may be peripheral vasodilation with a fall in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. In such an event, monitoring of cardiac function and general supportive measures should be used.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sergel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sergel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sergel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sergel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sergel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sergel.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sergel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sergel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sergel include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sergel does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sergel capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sergel capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sergel.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sergel in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sergel is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sergel at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sergel. No specific antidote for Sergel is known. Since Sergel is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pantoprazole has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be cautioned that Trupan tablet should not be split, chewed or crushed. Long-term therapy of Trupan may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) or may increase the risk of osteoporosis related disorders.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no known symptoms of overdosage in humans. Since Trupan is highly protein bound, it is not readily dialyzable. Apart from symptomatic and supportive management, no specific therapy is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rReconstitution\rDirection for use of IV injection: Trupan lyophilized powder and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rabe with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rabe is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabe may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rabe does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rabe 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rabe gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rabe 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rabe is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rabe, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rabe. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rabe 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rabe is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rabe is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Rabe 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Rabe 20 mg Tablet?\rRabe 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Rabe 20 mg Tablet used for?\rRabe 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Rabe 20 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Rabe 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rabe with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Rabe is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabe may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Rabe does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rabe 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\rEnsures greater bioavailability.\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\rEnsures uniform drug release.\rOnce daily dosing.\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\rIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\rpellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rPharmacology\rThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\rDosage\rErosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\rRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\rH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r Children 1-11 years:\rErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

The tablets should not be chewed or crushed. If required, the tablets can also be dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated water (mineral water is not suitable). No other liquids should be used. Stir until the tablets disintegrate and drink the liquid with the pellets immediately or within 30 minutes. Rinse the glass with half a glass of water and drink. The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOthera is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Othera is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Othera does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Othera may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Othera metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Othera 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Othera inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Othera may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Othera.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Othera, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Othera and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Othera include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r\nEnsures greater bioavailability.\r\nEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\r\nEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\r\nIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\r\nEnsures uniform drug release.\r\nOnce daily dosing.\r\nEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\r\nEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\r\nIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\r\nMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\r\nMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r\n \nA further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\r\npellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\r\nDosage\r\nErosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\nH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r\n \nChildren 1-11 years:\r\nErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Othera is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Othera does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nOthera may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Othera metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Othera 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Othera inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Othera may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Othera.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Othera, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Othera and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Othera include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that NexCap is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that NexCap does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nNexCap may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major NexCap metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of NexCap 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. NexCap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, NexCap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of NexCap.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of NexCap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of NexCap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with NexCap include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with NexCap does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: NexCap capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the NexCap capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking NexCap.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of NexCap in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of NexCap is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of NexCap at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with NexCap. No specific antidote for NexCap is known. Since NexCap is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. NexCap inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, NexCap may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of NexCap.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of NexCap, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of NexCap and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with NexCap include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with NexCap does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: NexCap capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the NexCap capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking NexCap.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of NexCap in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of NexCap is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of NexCap at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with NexCap. No specific antidote for NexCap is known. Since NexCap is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about NexCap 20 mg Capsule\r\nWhat is NexCap 20 mg Capsule?\r\nNexCap 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The suspension work in two ways-\rNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\rForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\rThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\rGaviraft - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rFor oral suspension:\rAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\rElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\rChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed.

This drug can be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: Pre-clinical investigations have revealed Alginate has no negative effect on parental or offspring fertility or reproduction. Clinical data do not suggest that this drug has an effect on human fertility.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEach 20 ml of dose has a sodium content of 254.5 mg (11.06 mmol). This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g. in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment.\r Each 20 ml contains 260 mg (6.5 mmol) of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis, and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi.\r Treatment of children younger than 12 years of age is not generally recommended, except on medical advice.\r Gastrocon-DA is considered high in sodium. This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g., in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment. Each tablet contains 75 mg of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi. Due to its aspartame content Gastrocon-DA should not be given to patients with phenylketonuria. If symptoms persist, or treatment is required for more than 7 days continuously, medical advice should be sought. Taking Gastrocon-DA can mask the symptoms of other more serious, underlying medical conditions. It should not be used in patients with impaired renal function/insufficiency and with hypophosphatemia. This may cause allergic reactions.\rOverdose Effects\rIn the event of over dosage symptomatic treatment should be given.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDysnov should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rRabeca Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rabeca with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rabeca is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabeca may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rabeca does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rabeca 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rabeca gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rabeca 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rabeca is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rabeca, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rabeca. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rabeca 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rabeca is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rabeca is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Rabeca 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Rabeca 20 mg Tablet?\rRabeca 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Rabeca 20 mg Tablet used for?\rRabeca 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Rabeca 20 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Rabeca 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

        "description": "Indication:\rConstipation, hepatic encephalopathy.\rDosage & Administration:\rConstipation: Initially Osmolax\u00ae solution may be given twice daily. In due course the dose should be adjusted according to the\rneeds of the individual, but the following serves as a guide:-\rStarting dose:\rAdults: (including the elderly) - 15 ml twice daily.\rChildren: 5 to 10 years - 10 ml twice daily.\rChildren under 5 years - 5 ml twice daily.\rBabies under 1 year - 2.5 ml twice daily.\rOsmolax\u00ae solution may, if necessary, be taken with water, fruit juice etc.\r Hepatic encephalopathy:\rAdults (including the elderly): Initially 30-50 ml three times a day. Subsequently adjust the dose to produce two or three soft\rstools each day.\rChildren: No dosage recommended for this indication.\rBecause of Lactulose's physiological mode of action it may take up to 48 hours before effects are obtained.

In due course the dose should be adjusted according to the\r\nneeds of the individual, but the following serves as a guide:-\r\nStarting dose:\r\nAdults: (including the elderly) - 15 ml twice daily.\r\nChildren: 5 to 10 years - 10 ml twice daily.\r\nChildren under 5 years - 5 ml twice daily.\r\nBabies under 1 year - 2.5 ml twice daily.\r\nOsmolax\u00ae solution may, if necessary, be taken with water, fruit juice etc.\r\n \nHepatic encephalopathy:\r\nAdults (including the elderly): Initially 30-50 ml three times a day. Subsequently adjust the dose to produce two or three soft\r\nstools each day.\r\nChildren: No dosage recommended for this indication.\r\nBecause of Lactulose's physiological mode of action it may take up to 48 hours before effects are obtained.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r\n \nIV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNexum is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Nexum is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Nexum does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nNexum may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Nexum metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Nexum 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Nexum inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Nexum may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Nexum.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Nexum, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Nexum and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Nexum include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Nexum does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Nexum capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Nexum capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Nexum.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Nexum in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Nexum is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Nexum at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Nexum. No specific antidote for Nexum is known. Since Nexum is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about Nexum 40 mg Capsule\r\nWhat is Nexum 40 mg Capsule?\r\nNexum 40 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

In doing so, it increases intestinal motility, thus aiding the passage of stool and relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation.\r Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.\rDosage & Administration\rIrritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation: The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.\r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily. If tolerated then dose can be increased to 8 mcg twice \r Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Opioid-induced Constipation: The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water. \r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily.

In doing so, it increases intestinal motility, thus aiding the passage of stool and relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation.\r\n \nLubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation: The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.\r\n \nDosage in patients with hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily. If tolerated then dose can be increased to 8 mcg twice \r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Constipation and Opioid-induced Constipation: The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water. \r\n \nDosage in patients with hepatic impairment: For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily.

        "description": "Indications\rCaloprid is indicated for symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in adults in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief.\rPharmacology\rPrucalopride acts as a selective stimulator of the 5-HT4 receptors while having no interaction with hERG channel or 5-HT1 receptors which reduces significantly the cardiovascular risk found in other similar drugs. 5-HT4 receptors can be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract primarily in smooth muscle cells, enterochromaffin cells, and myenteric plexus. Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of the day. Due to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the daily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy.\r Older people: Start with 1 mg once daily; if needed the dose can be increased to 2 mg once daily.\r Children: Prucalopride should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIn-vitro data indicate that, Caloprid has a low interaction potential and therapeutic concentrations of Caloprid are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co medicated medicinal products. Although Caloprid may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations.\r Ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.\r Studies in healthy subjects showed that, there were no clinically relevant effects of Caloprid on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, paroxetine or oral contraceptives.\rContraindications\rPrucalopride is contraindicated in those people who are hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients and people with renal impairment requiring dialysis.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Caloprid therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain), nausea and diarrhoea. The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPrucalopride is not recommended during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition, or postnatal development. In the absence of human data, it is not recommended to use Prucalopride during breastfeeding\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. A dose of 1 mg is recommended in subjects with severe renal impairment.\rCaution should be exercised when prescribing Caloprid to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rIn case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception.\rThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal Impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start with 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg dose is well tolerated. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride's known pharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not available for Caloprid overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances.\rTherapeutic Class\rOsmotic purgatives\rStorage Conditions\rStore at room temperature, below 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rAsynta is indicated for the treatment of symptoms resulting from the reflux of acid, bile and pepsin into the esophagus such as acid regurgitation, heartburn, indigestion for instance, after gastric surgery, as a result of hiatus hernia, during pregnancy, accompanying reflux esophagitis, including symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux such as hoarseness and other voice disorders, sore throats and cough. Asynta can also be used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux during concomitant treatment with or following the withdrawal of acid suppressing therapy.\rPharmacology\rThis is the combination of Sodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate. Sodium Alginate is a naturally occurring substance. It reacts with the acid in the stomach to form a gel. Potassium Bicarbonate also reacts with the acid in the stomach to form bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles are trapped by the gel formed by Sodium Alginate and they allow the gel to float like a raft on top of the stomach contents. The raft prevents acid in the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. This relieves the symptoms of reflux such as heartburn. The mode of action of this is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The raft lasts for up to 4 hours on top of the stomach contents and is then broken down in the digestive system and excreted in the feces.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdults and children over 12 years: 1-2 tablets 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.\rChildren 6-12 years: \u00bd-1 tablet 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.\rSuspension:\rAdults and children 12 years and above: 5-10 ml (1-2 teaspoonfuls) 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.\rChildren 2-12 years: 2.5-5ml (\u00bd-1 teaspoonful) 3-4 times daily, after meals and before bedtime.\rUse in children: This is not recommended under 2 years of age.\rElderly: No dose modifications are necessary for this age group.\rHepatic Impairment: No dose modifications are necessary.\rRenal Insufficiency: Caution if a highly restricted salt diet is necessary.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rA time interval of 2 hours should be considered between this intake and the administration of other medicinal products, especially tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, iron salts, thyroid hormones, chloroquine, bisphosphonates, and estramustine.\rContraindications\rSodium alginate and potassium bicarbonate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to these.\rSide Effects\rIn addition to the desired effect of the drug, some side effects may appear such as: nausea, constipation, diarrhea or headache. In these cases consult a physician In case too big dosage has been taken, there might appear a sensation of swelling. In this case it is advisable to consult a physician.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThis combination (Sodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate) can be used during pregnancy, if clinically needed. No known effect on breast-fed infants. This combination can be used during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSodium Alginate and Potassium Bicarbonate should be prescribed with caution in patients with renal impairment and congestive cardiac failure. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis and recurrent calcium-containing renal calculi. There is a possibility of reduced efficacy in patients with very low levels of gastric acid.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Probitor treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Probitor is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Probitor 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Probitor 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Probitor and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Probitor is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Probitor and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rProbitor is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Probitor as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Probitor. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Probitor treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Probitor is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Probitor 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Probitor 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Probitor and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Probitor is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Probitor and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rProbitor is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Probitor as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Probitor. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNeptor is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Neptor is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Neptor does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Neptor may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Neptor metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Neptor 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Neptor inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Neptor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Neptor.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Neptor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Neptor and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Neptor include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Neptor does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Neptor capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Neptor capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Neptor.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Neptor in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Neptor is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Neptor at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Neptor. No specific antidote for Neptor is known. Since Neptor is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nAbsorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma ...

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r\n \nIV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNeptor is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Neptor is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Neptor does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nNeptor may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Neptor metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Neptor 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Neptor inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Neptor may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Neptor.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Neptor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Neptor and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Neptor include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Neptor does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Neptor capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Neptor capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Neptor.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Neptor in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Neptor is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Neptor at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Neptor. No specific antidote for Neptor is known. Since Neptor is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about Neptor 20 mg Capsule\r\nWhat is Neptor 20 mg Capsule?\r\nNeptor 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The tablets should not be chewed or crushed. If required, the tablets can also be dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated water (mineral water is not suitable). No other liquids should be used. Stir until the tablets disintegrate and drink the liquid with the pellets immediately or within 30 minutes. Rinse the glass with half a glass of water and drink.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Maxpro MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro MUPS.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxpro MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMaxpro MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Maxpro MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nMaxpro MUPS is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nMaxpro MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro MUPS.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxpro MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMaxpro MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Maxpro MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\r\nCommon Questions about Maxpro MUPS 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Maxpro MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table?\r\nMaxpro MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Prazo treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Prazo is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Prazo 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Prazo 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Prazo and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Prazo is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Prazo and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rPrazo is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Prazo as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Prazo. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Ometid treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Ometid is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Ometid 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Ometid 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Ometid and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Ometid is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Ometid and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rOmetid is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Ometid as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Ometid. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rOmetid is indicated for the treatment of-\rGastric and duodenal ulcer\rNSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\rAs prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease\rAcid-related dyspepsia\rSevere ulcerating reflux esophagitis\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration during general anesthesia\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome\rHelicobacter pylori-induced peptic ulcer.\rPeptex - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rOmeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Ometid treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Ometid is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Ometid 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Ometid 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Ometid and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Ometid is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Ometid and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rOmetid is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Ometid as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly.

        "description": "Indications\rFinix Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rFinix - MedEx campaign banner\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Finix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Finix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Finix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Finix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Finix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Finix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Finix is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Finix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Finix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Finix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Finix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Finix 10 mg Capsule\rWhat is Finix 10 mg Capsule?\rFinix 10 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Finix 10 mg Capsule used for?\rFinix 10 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Finix 10 mg Capsule?\rThe most common side effects of Finix 10 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Finix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Finix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Finix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Finix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Finix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\r\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\r\nPatients should be cautioned that Finix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\r\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Finix is not recommended.\r\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\r\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r\n \nInfluence on vitamin B12 absorption: Finix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r\n \nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Finix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nInterference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric populations: Finix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Finix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Finix 10 mg Capsule\r\nWhat is Finix 10 mg Capsule?\r\nFinix 10 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\r\nWhat is Finix 10 mg Capsule used for?\r\nFinix 10 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\r\nWhat are the side effects of Finix 10 mg Capsule?\r\nThe most common side effects of Finix 10 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEsotid is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotid is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotid does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esotid may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotid metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotid 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esotid include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esotid does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esotid capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esotid capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esotid.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esotid in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esotid is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esotid at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esotid. No specific antidote for Esotid is known. Since Esotid is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esotid is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esotid does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nEsotid may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esotid metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esotid 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esotid include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esotid does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esotid capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esotid capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esotid.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esotid in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esotid is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esotid at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esotid. No specific antidote for Esotid is known. Since Esotid is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esotid inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esotid may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esotid.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esotid, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esotid and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esotid include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esotid does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esotid capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esotid capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esotid.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esotid in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esotid is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esotid at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esotid. No specific antidote for Esotid is known. Since Esotid is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about Esotid 40 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Esotid 40 mg Tablet?\r\nEsotid 40 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

        "description": "Indications\rRablet Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rFinix - MedEx campaign banner\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rablet with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rablet is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rablet may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rablet does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rablet 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rablet gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rablet 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rablet is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rablet, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rablet. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rablet 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rablet is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rablet is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Rablet 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Rablet 20 mg Tablet?\rRablet 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Rablet 20 mg Tablet used for?\rRablet 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Rablet 20 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Rablet 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Co-administration of Rablet with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Rablet is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rablet may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Rablet does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rablet 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\r\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\r\nPatients should be cautioned that Rablet gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rablet 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\r\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Rablet is not recommended.\r\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\r\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r\n \nInfluence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rablet, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r\n \nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rablet. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nInterference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rablet 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric populations: Rablet is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rablet is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Rablet 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Rablet 20 mg Tablet?\r\nRablet 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\r\nWhat is Rablet 20 mg Tablet used for?\r\nRablet 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\r\nWhat are the side effects of Rablet 20 mg Tablet?\r\nThe most common side effects of Rablet 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rasonix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rasonix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rasonix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rasonix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rasonix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rasonix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rasonix is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rasonix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rasonix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rasonix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rasonix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOmidon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r\n \nThe usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\r\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\r\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\r\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\r\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\r\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Omenix treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Omenix is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Omenix 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Omenix 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Omenix and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Omenix is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Omenix and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rOmenix is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Omenix as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Omenix. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEsonix is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonix is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonix does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esonix may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonix metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonix 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonix inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonix may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonix.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonix, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonix and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esonix include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esonix does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esonix capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esonix capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esonix.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esonix in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esonix is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esonix at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esonix. No specific antidote for Esonix is known. Since Esonix is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\rEnsures greater bioavailability.\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\rEnsures uniform drug release.\rOnce daily dosing.\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\rIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\rpellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rPharmacology\rThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\rDosage\rErosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\rRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\rH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r Children 1-11 years:\rErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esonix M is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esonix M does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esonix M may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esonix M metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esonix M 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esonix M inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esonix M may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esonix M.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esonix M, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esonix M and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esonix M include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEsonix M should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Esonix M may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

        "description": "Indications\rBarcavir is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevation in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease.\rPharmacology\rBy competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt):\rBase priming,\rReverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and\rSynthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Upon activation by kinases, the drug can be incorporated into the DNA which has the ultimate effect of inhibiting the HBV polymerase activity.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Entecavir for chronic hepatitis B virus infection in nucleoside-treatment-naive adults and adolescents 16 years of age is 0.5 mg once daily. For Lamivudine-refractory or known Lamivudine or Telbivudine resistance mutations, the recommended dose of Entecavir is 1 mg once daily. For patients with decompensated liver disease (adult) the recommended dose of Entecavir is 1 mg once daily. Entecavir should be administered on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after a meal or 2 hours before the next meal).\r Missed Dose: If it is almost time for next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the proper time. Nobody should take a double dose to make up for the missed dose.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of Barcavir with Lamivudine or Adefovir dipivoxil did not result in significant drug interactions. The effects of co-administration of Barcavir with other drugs that are eliminated through renal or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when coadministered with such drugs.\rContraindications\rEntecavir is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to Entecavir or any component of the product.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse events are headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no data on the effect of Entecavir on the transmission of HBV from mother to infant. Therefore, appropriate care should be taken. It is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are taking Entecavir.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination with antiretrovirals.\r Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including Barcavir.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric: Safety and effectiveness of Barcavir in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.\r Geriatric: Clinical studies of Barcavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. But care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\r Dose adjustment in renal impairment: Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with CrCl <50 ml/min including patients on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) as shown below:\rCrCl \u226550 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 24 hours\rCrCl 30 to <50 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 48 hours\rCrCl 10 to <30 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 72 hours\rCrCl <10 ml/min or  Hemodialysis or CAPD: 0.5 mg every 7 days\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of Barcavir overdosage reported in patients. Healthy subjects who received up to 20 mg daily for up to 14 days and single doses up to 40 mg had no unexpected adverse events. If overdosage occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and standard supportive treatment as necessary.\rTherapeutic Class\rHepatic viral infections (Hepatitis B)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place and store below 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nBarcavir is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevation in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBy competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt):\r\nBase priming,\r\nReverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and\r\nSynthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Upon activation by kinases, the drug can be incorporated into the DNA which has the ultimate effect of inhibiting the HBV polymerase activity.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Entecavir for chronic hepatitis B virus infection in nucleoside-treatment-naive adults and adolescents 16 years of age is 0.5 mg once daily. For Lamivudine-refractory or known Lamivudine or Telbivudine resistance mutations, the recommended dose of Entecavir is 1 mg once daily. For patients with decompensated liver disease (adult) the recommended dose of Entecavir is 1 mg once daily. Entecavir should be administered on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after a meal or 2 hours before the next meal).\r\n \nMissed Dose: If it is almost time for next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the proper time. Nobody should take a double dose to make up for the missed dose.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administration of Barcavir with Lamivudine or Adefovir dipivoxil did not result in significant drug interactions. The effects of co-administration of Barcavir with other drugs that are eliminated through renal or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when coadministered with such drugs.\r\nContraindications\r\nEntecavir is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to Entecavir or any component of the product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse events are headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no data on the effect of Entecavir on the transmission of HBV from mother to infant. Therefore, appropriate care should be taken. It is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are taking Entecavir.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination with antiretrovirals.\r\n \nExacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including Barcavir.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric: Safety and effectiveness of Barcavir in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric: Clinical studies of Barcavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. But care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\r\n \nDose adjustment in renal impairment: Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with CrCl <50 ml/min including patients on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) as shown below:\r\nCrCl \u226550 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 24 hours\r\nCrCl 30 to <50 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 48 hours\r\nCrCl 10 to <30 ml/min: 0.5 mg every 72 hours\r\nCrCl <10 ml/min or  Hemodialysis or CAPD: 0.5 mg every 7 days\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of Barcavir overdosage reported in patients. Healthy subjects who received up to 20 mg daily for up to 14 days and single doses up to 40 mg had no unexpected adverse events. If overdosage occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity and standard supportive treatment as necessary.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nHepatic viral infections (Hepatitis B)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place and store below 30\u00b0C.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSergel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sergel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sergel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sergel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sergel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sergel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sergel.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sergel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sergel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sergel include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sergel does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sergel capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sergel capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sergel.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sergel in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sergel is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sergel at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sergel. No specific antidote for Sergel is known. Since Sergel is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSergel is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sergel is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sergel does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sergel may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sergel metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sergel 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sergel.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sergel, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sergel and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sergel include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sergel does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sergel capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sergel capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sergel.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sergel in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sergel is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sergel at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sergel. No specific antidote for Sergel is known. Since Sergel is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\rEnsures greater bioavailability.\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\rEnsures uniform drug release.\rOnce daily dosing.\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\rIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\rpellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rPharmacology\rThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r\nEnsures greater bioavailability.\r\nEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\r\nEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\r\nIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\r\nEnsures uniform drug release.\r\nOnce daily dosing.\r\nEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\r\nEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\r\nIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\r\nMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\r\nMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r\n \nA further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\r\npellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\r\nDosage\r\nErosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\nH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r\n \nChildren 1-11 years:\r\nErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

The tablets should not be chewed or crushed. If required, the tablets can also be dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated water (mineral water is not suitable). No other liquids should be used. Stir until the tablets disintegrate and drink the liquid with the pellets immediately or within 30 minutes. Rinse the glass with half a glass of water and drink. The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nSergel MUPS is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sergel MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sergel MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nSergel MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sergel MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sergel MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sergel MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sergel MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sergel MUPS.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sergel MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sergel MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sergel MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSergel MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Sergel MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\r\nCommon Questions about Sergel MUPS 40 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Sergel MUPS 40 mg MUPS Table?\r\nSergel MUPS 40 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Losectil treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Losectil is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losectil and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rLosectil is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Losectil as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Losectil. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losectil and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\r\nContraindications\r\nOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nLosectil is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r\n \nUse in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Losectil as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Losectil. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\n",

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Losectil treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Losectil is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technology that combines the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r Clinical advantage of omeprazole MUPS tablet compared to conventional modified-release omeprazole tablets and pellet-filled omeprazole capsules:\rEnsures greater bioavailability\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax (peak time and peak plasma concentration)\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action\rEnsures uniform drug release\rOnce daily dosing\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption\rBetter than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rPharmacodynamic advantage:\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface, uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\rA further reduction in inter-and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping(in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rDosage\rAdult:\rGERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease): 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rGastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\rDuodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\rNSAID-induced ulceration: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\rReflux esophagitis: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\rH. pylori eradication (Omeprazole MUPS tablet with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin or Metronidazole): 20 mg twice daily for 1 week.\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: 60 mg once daily; Usual maintenance, 20-120 mg daily.\rChildren over 2 years old:\rAcid regurgitation in GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease): 20 mg once daily for 2-4 week.\rReflux esophagitis: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rTake the tablet before or after a meal.\rSwallow the tablet whole with a glass of water.

It is the more recent and challenging technology that combines the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r\n \nClinical advantage of omeprazole MUPS tablet compared to conventional modified-release omeprazole tablets and pellet-filled omeprazole capsules:\r\nEnsures greater bioavailability\r\nEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax (peak time and peak plasma concentration)\r\nEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping\r\nIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action\r\nEnsures uniform drug release\r\nOnce daily dosing\r\nEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation\r\nEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption\r\nBetter than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time\r\nMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\r\nPharmacodynamic advantage:\r\nMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface, uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r\nA further reduction in inter-and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional pellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping(in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\r\nDosage\r\nAdult:\r\nGERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease): 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nGastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\r\nDuodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\r\nNSAID-induced ulceration: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\nReflux esophagitis: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks; in severe cases Twice daily.\r\nH. pylori eradication (Omeprazole MUPS tablet with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin or Metronidazole): 20 mg twice daily for 1 week.\r\nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: 60 mg once daily; Usual maintenance, 20-120 mg daily.\r\nChildren over 2 years old:\r\nAcid regurgitation in GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease): 20 mg once daily for 2-4 week.\r\nReflux esophagitis: 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nTake the tablet before or after a meal.\r\nSwallow the tablet whole with a glass of water. The tablet must not be chewed or crushed. OR\r\nIf the patients have trouble swallowing the tablets, put the tablet into a glass of water (Do not use other liquids). Stir the preparation until the tablets disintegrate. Then drink the liquid within 30 minutes. Stir the mixture just always before drinking.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nLosectil MUPS is metabolized through CYP2C19 . When starting or stopping treatment with Losectil MUPS should be taken into account potential interactions with medicines which are CYP2C19 metabolized.\r\nContraindications\r\nOmeprazole is contraindicated in those patients who have known hypersensitivity to any other components of the formulation.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nNot known to be harmful. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. Omeprazole is excreted in breast milk but is not likely to influence the child when therapeutic doses are used.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLosectil MUPS tablet should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool (below 25\u00b0C) and dry place, protected from light and moisture.",

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Losectil treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Losectil is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losectil and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rLosectil is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Losectil as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Losectil. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Losectil treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Losectil is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Losectil 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Losectil and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Losectil is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Losectil and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rLosectil is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Losectil as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Losectil. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEsoral is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoral is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esoral may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esoral include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esoral does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esoral capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esoral capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esoral.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esoral in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esoral is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esoral at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esoral. No specific antidote for Esoral is known. Since Esoral is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoral is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nEsoral may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esoral include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esoral does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esoral capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esoral capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esoral.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esoral in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esoral is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esoral at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esoral. No specific antidote for Esoral is known. Since Esoral is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esoral include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esoral does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esoral capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esoral capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esoral.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esoral in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esoral is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esoral at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esoral. No specific antidote for Esoral is known. Since Esoral is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about Esoral 40 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Esoral 40 mg Tablet?\r\nEsoral 40 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esoral does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esoral capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esoral capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esoral.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esoral in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esoral is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esoral at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esoral. No specific antidote for Esoral is known. Since Esoral is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r\n \nIV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nEsoral is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esoral is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esoral does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nEsoral may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esoral metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esoral 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esoral inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esoral may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esoral.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esoral, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esoral and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esoral include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

The cholesterol saturation of bile is reduced by Ursolic, allowing gradual solubilization of cholesterol gallstones. Cholesterol of secretion into bile is reduced and bile acid secretion rate is increased during Ursolic treatment without a reduction in phospholipids.\r\nPharmacology\r\nUrsodeoxycholic Acid is a naturally occurring bile acid used to treat different hepatobilliary disorders. The activity of Ursodeoxycholic Acid is achieved through a decrease in secretion of cholesterol in bile. Ursodeoxycholic Acid achieves this through a few mechanisms: it reduces cholesterol absorption, suppresses liver cholesterol synthesis and it does not inhibit bile acid synthesis.\r\n \nTherefore, alters bile composition from supersaturated to unsaturated. Ursodeoxycholic Acid also promotes the formation of liquid cholesterol crystal complexes which enhance removal of the cholesterol from the gallbladder into the intestine to be expelled. Ursodeoxycholic Acid improves cholestatic liver diseases by-\r\nProtecting cholangiocytes against cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids\r\nStimulating hepatobilliary secretion\r\nProtecting hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis\r\nUrsodeoxycholic Acid is completely absorbed in the upper intestine. Time to peak serum concentration varies from 30 to 150 minutes. The rate of absorption ranges from 60-80%. After absorption Ursodeoxycholic Acid enters the portal vein and undergoes extraction from portal blood by liver where it is conjugated with amino acid & that may be either glycine or taurine and then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Small quantities of Ursodeoxycholic Acid appear in the circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The biologic half life of Ursodeoxycholic Acid ranges from 3.5-5.8 days.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDissolution of Gall stones: 8-12 mg/kg/day either as single night time dose or in divided doses.\r\n \nPrimary Billiary Cirrhosis: 10-15 mg/kg/day in 2-4 divided doses.\r\n \nAcute Viral Hepatitis: 600 mg/day.\r\n \nAlcoholic Fatty Liver: 300 mg/day.\r\n \nPrimary Sclerosing Cholangitis: 25-30 mg/kg/day.\r\n \nDissolution of Gallstones and Non-Alcoholic Steato Hepatitis: 13-15 mg/kg/day.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nUrsolic should not be used with drugs, such as oestrogenic hormones, that increase bile cholesterol. Concomitant administration with bile-acid binding drugs including antacids, charcoal and cholestyramine should be avoided, since this may reduce the effectiveness of therapy with Ursolic.\r\nContraindications\r\nNon-functioning gall-bladder calcified and pigmented gallstones, inflammatory bowel disease.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommonly reported side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gallstone opacilication, pruritus.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category B.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\rEnsures greater bioavailability.\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\rEnsures uniform drug release.\rOnce daily dosing.\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\rIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\rpellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rPharmacology\rThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\rDosage\rErosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\rMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\rRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\rH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\rAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r Children 1-11 years:\rErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

The tablets should not be chewed or crushed. If required, the tablets can also be dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated water (mineral water is not suitable). No other liquids should be used. Stir until the tablets disintegrate and drink the liquid with the pellets immediately or within 30 minutes. Rinse the glass with half a glass of water and drink. The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPronex-MUPS is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Pronex-MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Pronex-MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Pronex-MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Pronex-MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Pronex-MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Pronex-MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Pronex-MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Pronex-MUPS.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Pronex-MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Pronex-MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Pronex-MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPronex-MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Pronex-MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\rCommon Questions about Pronex-MUPS 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Pronex-MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table?\rPronex-MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r\nEnsures greater bioavailability.\r\nEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\r\nEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\r\nIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\r\nEnsures uniform drug release.\r\nOnce daily dosing.\r\nEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\r\nEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\r\nIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\r\nMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\r\nMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r\n \nA further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\r\npellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\r\nDosage\r\nErosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\nH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r\n \nChildren 1-11 years:\r\nErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Pronex-MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Pronex-MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nPronex-MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Pronex-MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Pronex-MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Pronex-MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Pronex-MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Pronex-MUPS.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Pronex-MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Pronex-MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Pronex-MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPronex-MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Pronex-MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Pronex is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Pronex does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nPronex may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Pronex metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Pronex 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Pronex inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Pronex may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Pronex.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Pronex, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Pronex and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Pronex include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Pronex does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Pronex capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Pronex capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Pronex.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Pronex in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Pronex is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Pronex at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Pronex. No specific antidote for Pronex is known. Since Pronex is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Therefore, Pronex may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Pronex.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Pronex, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Pronex and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Pronex include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Pronex does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Pronex capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Pronex capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Pronex.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Pronex in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Pronex is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Pronex at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Pronex. No specific antidote for Pronex is known. Since Pronex is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole\r\nCommon Questions about Pronex 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Pronex 20 mg Tablet?\r\nPronex 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParidon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\r\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\r\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\r\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\r\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\r\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\r\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\r\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\r\nContraindications\r\nDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nParidon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

It is reported to be useful in elderly patients and in those with diabetes and albuminuria. Mydipin has been increasingly used in patients with chronic kidney disease\r Hypertension is the term used to describe the presence of high blood pressure. The blood pressure is generated by the force of the blood pumped from the heart against the blood vessels. Thus hypertension is caused when there is too much pressure on the blood vessels and this effect can damage the blood vessel\rPharmacology\rCilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. Cilnidipine binds to the dihydropy-ridine binding sites of the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel and inhibits Ca2+ influx across the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells via this channel, consequently vascular smooth muscle is relaxed, causing vasodilation. Cilnidipine inhibits Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channels in the sympathetic nerve cell membrane. The inhibition of Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channel was observed over a similar range of drug concentrations to those inhibiting L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channels. Consequently, release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals would be inhibited. Cilnidipine is considered to suppress the reflex increase in heart rate after blood pressure reduction.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 5-10 mg once daily after breakfast.

Such potential interactions can be reduced by separating the administration of each product by several hours. In patients with renal failure a risk of Zinc accumulation could exist.\rOverdose Effects\rIron overdosage is dangerous, particularly in children and requires immediate attention. Gastric lavage should be carried out in the early stages, or if this is not possible vomiting should be induced. These procedures should not be undertaken where signs of the corrosive effects of zinc are present. Give oral desferrioxamine (2 gm for a child or 5 gm for an adult) and demulcent. If serum Iron levels at 4 hours or more post-ingestion are over 5mg/l in a child or 8 mg/l in adults, or if the patient is in shock of coma, intravenous desferrioxamine should be used. Zinc Sulphate in gross over dosage is corrosive. Symptoms are those of gastrointestinal irritation leading in severe cases to haemorrhage, corrosion of the mucosa and possible later stricture formation. Gastric lavage or emesis should be avoided. Demulcents such as milk should be given. Chelating agents such as Dimercaprol, Penicillamine or Edetic Acid have been recommended.\r Symptomatic and supportive measures should be given as required. The timed-release capsule presentation may delay excessive absorption of Iron and Zinc and allow more time for initiation of appropriate counter-measure.\rTherapeutic Class\rIron, Vitamin & Mineral Combined preparation\rStorage Conditions\rProtected from light and moisture, store below 30\u02daC.

Such potential interactions can be reduced by separating the administration of each product by several hours. In patients with renal failure a risk of Zinc accumulation could exist.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIron overdosage is dangerous, particularly in children and requires immediate attention. Gastric lavage should be carried out in the early stages, or if this is not possible vomiting should be induced. These procedures should not be undertaken where signs of the corrosive effects of zinc are present. Give oral desferrioxamine (2 gm for a child or 5 gm for an adult) and demulcent. If serum Iron levels at 4 hours or more post-ingestion are over 5mg/l in a child or 8 mg/l in adults, or if the patient is in shock of coma, intravenous desferrioxamine should be used. Zinc Sulphate in gross over dosage is corrosive. Symptoms are those of gastrointestinal irritation leading in severe cases to haemorrhage, corrosion of the mucosa and possible later stricture formation. Gastric lavage or emesis should be avoided. Demulcents such as milk should be given. Chelating agents such as Dimercaprol, Penicillamine or Edetic Acid have been recommended.\r\n \nSymptomatic and supportive measures should be given as required. The timed-release capsule presentation may delay excessive absorption of Iron and Zinc and allow more time for initiation of appropriate counter-measure.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nIron, Vitamin & Mineral Combined preparation\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nProtected from light and moisture, store below 30\u02daC. Keep out of reach of children.",

It also has the properties of an antihistamine. Ketotifen possesses marked anti-anaphylactic properties and is effective in preventing an asthmatic attacks. Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 1 mg twice daily with food.

SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition reduces renal absorption and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, resulting in increased glucose excretion. Additionally, it contributes to reduced hyperglycaemia, assists weight loss, and reduces blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Empagliflozin is 10 mg once daily, taken in the morning, with or without food. In patients tolerating Empagliflozin, the dose may be increased to 25 mg once daily.

The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Proceptin treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Proceptin is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Proceptin 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Proceptin 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Proceptin and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Proceptin is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Proceptin and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rProceptin is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Proceptin as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Proceptin. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nProceptin is indicated for the treatment of-\r\nGastric and duodenal ulcer\r\nNSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\r\nAs prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\r\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease\r\nLong-term management of acid reflux disease\r\nAcid-related dyspepsia\r\nSevere ulcerating reflux esophagitis\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration during general anesthesia\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\r\nHelicobacter pylori-induced peptic ulcer.\r\nPharmacology\r\nOmeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\r\nDosage\r\nOral-\r\nBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\r\nNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\r\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\r\nLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\r\nAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\r\nHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\r\nPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r\n \nIV Injection-\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\r\nDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\r\nZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually.

Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOpton is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Opton is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Opton does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Opton may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Opton metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Opton 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Opton inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Opton may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Opton.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Opton, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Opton and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Opton include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Opton does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Opton capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Opton capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Opton.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Opton in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Opton is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Opton at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Opton. No specific antidote for Opton is known. Since Opton is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Opton is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Opton does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Opton may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Opton metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Opton 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Opton inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Opton may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Opton.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Opton, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Opton and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Opton include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Opton does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Opton capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Opton capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Opton.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Opton in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Opton is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Opton at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Opton. No specific antidote for Opton is known. Since Opton is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOpton is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Opton is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Opton does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Opton may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Opton metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Opton 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Opton inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Opton may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Opton.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Opton, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Opton and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Opton include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Opton does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Opton capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Opton capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Opton.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Opton in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Opton is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Opton at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Opton. No specific antidote for Opton is known. Since Opton is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rGastalfet is indicated in adults and adolescents over 14 years old for treatment of-\rDuodenal ulcer\rGastric ulcer\rChronic gastritis\rThe prophylaxis of gastrointestinal hemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patients.\rPharmacology\rSucralfate is non-systemic as the drug is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The minute amount which absorbed primarily excretes in the urine. Sucralfate promotes the healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers by the formation of a chemical complex that binds to the ulcer site to establish a protective barrier. Besides, Sucralfate inhibits the action of pepsin and bile.\rDosage\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, chronic gastritis-\rAdults: The usual dose is Sucralfate 2 gm twice daily to be taken on rising and at bedtime or Sucralfate 1 gm four times a day to be taken 1 hour before meals and at bedtime. Maximum daily dose is 8 gm but up to twelve weeks may be necessary in resistant cases.\rPediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Sucralfate in children under 14 years of age has not been established.\rElderly: There are no special dosage requirements for elderly patients but as with all medicines the lowest effective dose should be used.\rProphylaxis of gastrointestinal hemorrhage from stress ulceration-\rAdults: The usual dose is Sucralfate 1 gm orally or via a nasogastric tube 4 to 6 times a day. To prevent clogging of the nasogastric tube flush with 10 ml of water following each administration. The duration of treatment for prophylaxis of stress ulceration must be individually determined. Treatment should be continued for as long as one or more of the risk factors for stress ulceration is present but normally not for more than 14 days.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rSucralfate should be taken on an empty stomach. Antacid should not be administered within 30 minutes of Sucralfate.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of Gastalfet may reduce the bioavailability of certain drugs including Fluoroquinolones such as Ciprofloxacin and Norfloxacin, Tetracycline, Ketoconazole, Sulpiride, Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenytoin, Theophylline, Levothyroxine, Quinidine, and H2 antagonists. The bioavailability of these agents may be restored by separating the administration of these agents from Gastalfet by two hours. This interaction appears to be non-systemic in origin presumably resulting from these agents being bound by Gastalfet in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the potential of Gastalfet to alter the absorption of some drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, the separate administration of Gastalfet from that of other agents should be considered when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical for concomitantly administered drugs. Gastalfet should not be co-administered with citrate preparations. Co-administration citrate preparations with Gastalfet may increase the blood concentrations of aluminium. The mechanism may be due to the chelation of aluminium which is assumed to increase its absorption. The administration of Gastalfet   1 g and enteral feeds by nasogastric tube should be separated by one hour in patients receiving Gastalfet 1 g for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration. In rare cases, bezoar formation has been reported when Gastalfet and enteral feeds have been given too closely together.\rContraindications\rSucralfate tablet and suspension are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sucralfate.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse event was headache (3.4%) followed by nausea (2.3%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhea (1.1%), and urticaria (1.1%). The majority of patients who reported bezoars, had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings. Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patient.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafety in pregnant women has not been established and Sucralfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Sucralfate is administered to breast-feeding women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGastalfet should only be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction, due to the possibility of increased aluminium absorption. Gastalfet is not recommended for use in individuals on dialysis. In patients with severe or chronic renal impairment, Gastalfet should be used with extreme caution and only for short-term treatment. Small amounts of aluminium are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and aluminium may accumulate. Aluminium osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy and anaemia have been reported in patients with chronic renal impairment. For patients with impairment of renal function, laboratory testing such as aluminium, phosphate, calcium and alkaline phosphatase is recommended to be periodically performed due to excretion impairment. The concomitant use of other aluminium containing medications is not recommended in view of the enhanced potential for aluminium absorption and toxicity. Bezoars have been reported after administration of Gastalfet mainly to severely ill patients in intensive care units. The majority of these patients (including neonates in whom Gastalfet is not recommended) had underlying conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying due to surgery, drug therapy or diseases that reduce motility) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Population: Gastalfet is not recommended for use in children under 14 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r In elderly patients: Dose adjustments are not necessary.\r Renal Impairment: Gastalfet should be used with caution in renal insufficiency patients.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Patients should not be drive if feel dizzy or drowsy.\rOverdose Effects\rIn a clinical trial on healthy men of overdose with Gastalfet, most cases remained asymptomatic but symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were reported in a few cases. Acute oral toxicity studies in animals using doses up to 12 gm/kg body weight could not find a lethal dose. Risks associated with overdose should therefore be minimal.\rTherapeutic Class\rChelating complex\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nGastalfet is indicated in adults and adolescents over 14 years old for treatment of-\r\nDuodenal ulcer\r\nGastric ulcer\r\nChronic gastritis\r\nThe prophylaxis of gastrointestinal hemorrhage from stress ulceration in seriously ill patients.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSucralfate is non-systemic as the drug is only minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

The bioavailability of these agents may be restored by separating the administration of these agents from Gastalfet by two hours. This interaction appears to be non-systemic in origin presumably resulting from these agents being bound by Gastalfet in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the potential of Gastalfet to alter the absorption of some drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, the separate administration of Gastalfet from that of other agents should be considered when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical for concomitantly administered drugs. Gastalfet should not be co-administered with citrate preparations. Co-administration citrate preparations with Gastalfet may increase the blood concentrations of aluminium. The mechanism may be due to the chelation of aluminium which is assumed to increase its absorption. The administration of Gastalfet   1 g and enteral feeds by nasogastric tube should be separated by one hour in patients receiving Gastalfet 1 g for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration. In rare cases, bezoar formation has been reported when Gastalfet and enteral feeds have been given too closely together.\r\nContraindications\r\nSucralfate tablet and suspension are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sucralfate.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse event was headache (3.4%) followed by nausea (2.3%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (1.1%), diarrhea (1.1%), and urticaria (1.1%). The majority of patients who reported bezoars, had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings. Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patient.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafety in pregnant women has not been established and Sucralfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Sucralfate is administered to breast-feeding women.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGastalfet should only be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction, due to the possibility of increased aluminium absorption. Gastalfet is not recommended for use in individuals on dialysis. In patients with severe or chronic renal impairment, Gastalfet should be used with extreme caution and only for short-term treatment. Small amounts of aluminium are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and aluminium may accumulate. Aluminium osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy and anaemia have been reported in patients with chronic renal impairment. For patients with impairment of renal function, laboratory testing such as aluminium, phosphate, calcium and alkaline phosphatase is recommended to be periodically performed due to excretion impairment. The concomitant use of other aluminium containing medications is not recommended in view of the enhanced potential for aluminium absorption and toxicity. Bezoars have been reported after administration of Gastalfet mainly to severely ill patients in intensive care units. The majority of these patients (including neonates in whom Gastalfet is not recommended) had underlying conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation (such as delayed gastric emptying due to surgery, drug therapy or diseases that reduce motility) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feeding.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Population: Gastalfet is not recommended for use in children under 14 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r\n \nIn elderly patients: Dose adjustments are not necessary.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Gastalfet should be used with caution in renal insufficiency patients.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: Patients should not be drive if feel dizzy or drowsy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn a clinical trial on healthy men of overdose with Gastalfet, most cases remained asymptomatic but symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were reported in a few cases. Acute oral toxicity studies in animals using doses up to 12 gm/kg body weight could not find a lethal dose. Risks associated with overdose should therefore be minimal.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nChelating complex\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.",

When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Omep treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Omep is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Omep 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Omep 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Omep and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Omep is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Omep and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rOmep is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Omep as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Omep. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEmep is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Emep is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Emep does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Emep may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Emep metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Emep 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Emep inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Emep may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Emep.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Emep, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Emep and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Emep include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Emep does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Emep capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Emep capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Emep.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Emep in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Emep is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Emep at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Emep. No specific antidote for Emep is known. Since Emep is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rConstipation (Chronic Constipation): In every case of chronic constipation, initial treatment should consist of a diet rich in fiber (vegetables, salads, fruits etc.) a generous amount of liquids and much physical exercise. Avolac is only to be taken when these measures prove insufficient.\r Intestinal flora disturbances:\rIn damaged to intestinal flora (e.g. following long-term antibiotic treatment)\rgall bladder diseases\rintestinal diseases ( Colitis, Diverticulosis, Megacolon)\rIncreased blood ammonia levels (hyper ammoniemia in hepatopathy, portal-systemic encephalopathy)\rDescription\rAvolac is a hyperosmolar laxative which is used as an effective treatment approach for constipation. It is a non-absorbable disaccharide which draws water into the bowel; causes distention through fluid accumulation, thus promotes soft stool and accelerates bowel motion.\rPharmacology\rLactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.\rDosage & Administration\rIn constipation ( chronic constipation):\rAdults: Initially 3-6 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1\u00bd-6 tea-spoons daily\rChildren up to 14 years: Initially 3 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1-2 tea-spoons daily\rInfants and toddlers: Initially 1-2 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1 tea-spoon daily\rIn damaged intestinal flora:\rAdults: 1-2 tea-spoons daily\rChildren: 1 tea-spoon daily\rFor reduction of blood ammonia level:\rHyper-ammoniemia in hepatopathy: a maximum of 18-30 tea-spoons daily.\rIn portal systemic encephalopathy: hourly doses of 6-9 tea-spoons of Lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose may then be reduced.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere is no significant drug interactions with Avolac. The glycosidic effect of cardiac glycosides can be intensified by potassium deficiency in abuse.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to either galactose and or lactose; galactose-free diet, gastro-cardial symptom complex, suspected intestinal obstruction.\rSide Effects\rOccasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA Pregnancy Category of Lactulose is B. Studies show that Lactulose has no adverse effects. Decisions regarding use during pregnancy and lactation must be made by registered physician.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvolac should be administered with care to patients who are intolerant to Avolac. The dose used in the treatment of (pre) coma hepaticum is usually much higher and may need to be taken into consideration for diabetics.\rOverdose Effects\rThere have been no reports of accidental overdosage. In the event of acute overdosage it is expected that diarrhoea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms.\rTherapeutic Class\rOsmotic purgatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Avolac is only to be taken when these measures prove insufficient.\r\n \nIntestinal flora disturbances:\r\nIn damaged to intestinal flora (e.g. following long-term antibiotic treatment)\r\ngall bladder diseases\r\nintestinal diseases ( Colitis, Diverticulosis, Megacolon)\r\nIncreased blood ammonia levels (hyper ammoniemia in hepatopathy, portal-systemic encephalopathy)\r\nDescription\r\nAvolac is a hyperosmolar laxative which is used as an effective treatment approach for constipation. It is a non-absorbable disaccharide which draws water into the bowel; causes distention through fluid accumulation, thus promotes soft stool and accelerates bowel motion.\r\nPharmacology\r\nLactulose is a synthetic disaccharide. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by the saccharolytic bacteria, producing low molecular weight organic acids (mainly lactic acid), which lowers the pH of the colon contents, promote the retention of water by an osmotic effect; thus increasing peristaltic activity. Lactulose is minimally absorbed; therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the absorbed material are not relevant to the principal therapeutic action.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nIn constipation ( chronic constipation):\r\nAdults: Initially 3-6 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1\u00bd-6 tea-spoons daily\r\nChildren up to 14 years: Initially 3 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1-2 tea-spoons daily\r\nInfants and toddlers: Initially 1-2 tea-spoons daily, In long-term therapy 1 tea-spoon daily\r\nIn damaged intestinal flora:\r\nAdults: 1-2 tea-spoons daily\r\nChildren: 1 tea-spoon daily\r\nFor reduction of blood ammonia level:\r\nHyper-ammoniemia in hepatopathy: a maximum of 18-30 tea-spoons daily.\r\nIn portal systemic encephalopathy: hourly doses of 6-9 tea-spoons of Lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation. When the laxative effect has been achieved, the dose may then be reduced.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nThere is no significant drug interactions with Avolac. The glycosidic effect of cardiac glycosides can be intensified by potassium deficiency in abuse.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to either galactose and or lactose; galactose-free diet, gastro-cardial symptom complex, suspected intestinal obstruction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOccasionally flatulence, cramp and abdominal discomfort can occur at the beginning of treatment; this is rapidly eliminated by reducing the dose. Overdose can result in diarrhoea. In abuse, loss of electrolytes (primarily potassium).\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA Pregnancy Category of Lactulose is B. Studies show that Lactulose has no adverse effects. Decisions regarding use during pregnancy and lactation must be made by registered physician.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvolac should be administered with care to patients who are intolerant to Avolac. The dose used in the treatment of (pre) coma hepaticum is usually much higher and may need to be taken into consideration for diabetics.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere have been no reports of accidental overdosage. In the event of acute overdosage it is expected that diarrhoea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOsmotic purgatives\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during PPI treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As PPI is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with PPI 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with PPI 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of PPI and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of PPI is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with PPI and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rPPI is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPI as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with PPI. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\r\nDosage\r\nOral-\r\nBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\r\nNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\r\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\r\nLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\r\nAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\r\nHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\r\nPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r\n \nIV Injection-\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\r\nDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\r\nZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r\n \nDirection for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during PPI treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As PPI is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with PPI 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with PPI 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of PPI and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of PPI is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with PPI and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\r\nContraindications\r\nOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nPPI is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r\n \nUse in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPI as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with PPI. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\n",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxima is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxima does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Maxima may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxima metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxima 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxima.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxima, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxima and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxima include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxima does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Maxima capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxima capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxima.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxima in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxima is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Maxima at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxima. No specific antidote for Maxima is known. Since Maxima is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxima does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Maxima capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxima capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxima.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxima in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxima is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Maxima at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxima. No specific antidote for Maxima is known. Since Maxima is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\rEnsures greater bioavailability.\rEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\rEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\rIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\rEnsures uniform drug release.\rOnce daily dosing.\rEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\rEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\rIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\rMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\rMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r A further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\rpellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\rPharmacology\rThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers.

However, from pharmaceutical industry and research perspective, the term in general refers to MUPS compacted into tablets. Thus, the resulting tablets prepared by compaction of modified release coated multiparticulates or pellets are called as MUPS. It is the more recent and challenging technologies that combine the advantages of both tablets and pellet-filled capsules in one dosage form.\r\nEnsures greater bioavailability.\r\nEnsures uniform emptying of micro pellets from stomach into small intestine facilitates rapid dissolution of enteric coating and drug release resulting in early Tmax and Cmax\r\nEnsures lesser possibility of dose dumping.\r\nIs a combination of fast acting and sustained action.\r\nEnsures uniform drug release.\r\nOnce daily dosing.\r\nEnsures lesser chance of localized irritation.\r\nEnsures better and more uniform drug absorption.\r\nIs better than capsules in reducing the esophageal residence time.\r\nMinimizes fluctuation in plasma concentration of drug.\r\nMUPS ensure rapid and uniform gastric emptying and subsequently uniform drug dissolution of pellets in the gastrointestinal tract due to their small size and larger surface,uniform drug absorption is facilitated which results in consistent and controlled pharmacological action.\r\n \nA further reduction in inter- and intra-subject variability in drug absorption and clinical response is facilitated since the number of pellets per MUPS dosage form is much more than a conventional\r\npellet-filled capsule and possibility of dose dumping (in stomach) and incomplete drug release is further minimized.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe proton pump inhibitor Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid by blocking the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the proton pump) of the gastric parietal cell. Proton pump inhibitors are effective for short-term treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Esomeprazole is also used in the prevention and treatment of NSAID associated gastric ulcers.\r\nDosage\r\nErosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks.\r\nMaintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg once daily.\r\nRisk reduction in NSAID associated gastric ulcer-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r\nH. pylori eradication (Esomeprazole MUPS tablet with 1000 mg Amoxicillin and 500 mg Clarithromycin)-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nChildren & adolescents (12-18 years): 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome and idiopathic hypersecretion-\r\nAdult (\u226518 years): 40-80 mg twice daily.\r\n \nChildren 1-11 years:\r\nErosive esophagitis: Weight <20 kg: 10 mg once daily for 8 weeks.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxima MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxima MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nMaxima MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxima MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxima MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxima MUPS.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxima MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxima MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxima MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMaxima MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Maxima MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r\n \nIV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nMaxima is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxima is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxima does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nMaxima may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxima metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxima 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxima inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxima may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxima.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxima, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxima and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxima include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxima does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Maxima capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxima capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxima.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxima in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxima is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Maxima at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxima. No specific antidote for Maxima is known. Since Maxima is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Xeldrin treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Xeldrin is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Xeldrin 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Xeldrin 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Xeldrin and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Xeldrin is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Xeldrin and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rXeldrin is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Xeldrin as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Xeldrin. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Xeldrin treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Xeldrin is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Xeldrin 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Xeldrin 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Xeldrin and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Xeldrin is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Xeldrin and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rXeldrin is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Xeldrin as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Xeldrin. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rPack Image of Pack Image: Xeldrin 20 mg Capsule (10 x 10)\r\nIndications\r\nXeldrin is indicated for the treatment of-\r\nGastric and duodenal ulcer\r\nNSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\r\nAs prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\r\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease\r\nLong-term management of acid reflux disease\r\nAcid-related dyspepsia\r\nSevere ulcerating reflux esophagitis\r\nProphylaxis of acid aspiration during general anesthesia\r\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\r\nHelicobacter pylori-induced peptic ulcer.\r\nPharmacology\r\nOmeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Paricel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Paricel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Paricel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Paricel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Paricel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Paricel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Paricel is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Paricel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Paricel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Paricel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Paricel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Paricel 20 mg Capsule\rWhat is Paricel 20 mg Capsule?\rParicel 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Paricel 20 mg Capsule used for?\rParicel 20 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Paricel 20 mg Capsule?\rThe most common side effects of Paricel 20 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Paricel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Paricel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Paricel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Paricel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Paricel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Paricel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Paricel is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Paricel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Paricel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Paricel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Paricel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Paricel 10 mg Tablet\rWhat is Paricel 10 mg Tablet?\rParicel 10 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Paricel 10 mg Tablet used for?\rParicel 10 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Paricel 10 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Paricel 10 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Paricel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Paricel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Paricel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Paricel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Paricel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Paricel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Paricel is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Paricel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Paricel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Paricel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Paricel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Paricel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Paricel 20 mg Capsule\rWhat is Paricel 20 mg Capsule?\rParicel 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Paricel 20 mg Capsule used for?\rParicel 20 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Paricel 20 mg Capsule?\rThe most common side effects of Paricel 20 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy.

This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus that persists longer than 24 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rBenign gastric ulcer: 40 mg daily in the morning for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20-40 mg daily in the morning for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed; maintenance dose is 20 mg daily, which may be increased to 40 mg daily.\rDuodenal ulcer: 40 mg daily in the morning for 2 weeks, continued for further 2 weeks if not fully healed.\rDuodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori: Pantoprazole is recommended at a dose of 40 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxycillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice daily for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice daily for one week.\rProphylaxis of NSAID-associated gastric or duodenal ulcer: 20 mg daily for those require long-term NSAID treatment.\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: Initially 80 mg once daily adjusted according to response (elderly max. 40 mg daily); daily doses above 80 mg given in 2 divided doses.\r IV Injection:\rDuodenal ulcer and gastric ulcer: 40 mg once daily for 7-10 days\rGastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis: 40 mg once daily for 7-10 days\rPrevention of rebleeding in peptic ulcer: IV 80 mg, followed by 8 mg/hour infusion for 72 hours\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 80 mg IV every 12 h for 24 h, followed by 40mg every 12 hour\rLong-term management of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome and other pathological hypersecretory conditions: 80 mg IV every 12 hours, may increase to 80 mg every 8 hours if needed, may titrate to higher doses depending on acid output.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions have been observed in clinical studies.\rContraindications\rPantoprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rPantex is well tolerated in both short-term and long-term treatment. Headache and diarrhea are the common side effects and rarely included side effects are abdominal pain, flatulence, rash, insomnia and hyperglycemia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA Pregnancy Category of Pantoprazole is B. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pantoprazole has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be cautioned that Pantex tablet should not be split, chewed or crushed. Long-term therapy of Pantex may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) or may increase the risk of osteoporosis related disorders.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no known symptoms of overdosage in humans. Since Pantex is highly protein bound, it is not readily dialyzable. Apart from symptomatic and supportive management, no specific therapy is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rReconstitution\rDirection for use of IV injection: Pantex lyophilized powder and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Othera is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Othera does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Othera may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Othera metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Othera 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Othera inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Othera may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Othera.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Othera, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Othera and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Othera include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOthera should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Othera may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOthera is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Othera is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Othera does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nOthera may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Othera metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Othera 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Othera inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Othera may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Othera.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Othera, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Othera and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Othera include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nOthera should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like Othera may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\r\nCommon Questions about Othera 40 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Othera 40 mg MUPS Table?\r\nOthera 40 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

        "description": "Indications\rEsomeprazole is indicated:\rTo relieve from chronic heartburn symptoms and other symptoms associated with GERD\rFor the healing of erosive esophagitis\rFor maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis\rIn combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rAcid related Dyspepsia\rDuodenal & Gastric ulcer\rCampaign Banner\rPharmacology\rEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.\r Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals.\r Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.\r Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.\r Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1\u20131.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces.\r Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.\rDosage\rHealing of Erosive Esophagitis: 20 mg or 40 mg Once Daily for 4-8 Weeks. The majority of patients are healed within 4 to 8 weeks. For patients who don't heal after 4-8 weeks, an additional 4-8 weeks of treatment may be considered. Maintenance of Healing of Erosive\r Esophagitis: 20 mg Once Daily (Clinical studies did not extend 6 months).\r Symptomatic GERD: 20 mg Once Daily for 4 Weeks. If symptoms do not resolve completely after 4 weeks, an additional 4 weeks of treatment may be considered.\r Helicobacter Pylori eradication: Triple Therapy to reduce the risk of Duodenal Ulcer recurrence-Esomeprazole 40 mg Once Daily for 10 days, Amoxicillin 1000 mg Twice Daily for 10 days, Clarithromycin 500 mg Twice Daily for 10 days.\r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The dose is 20-80 mg once daily. The dosage should be adjusted individually and treatment continued as long as clinically indicated.\r Acid-related Dyspepsia: 20-40 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks according to the response.\r Duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks. Gastric ulcer: 20-40 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r Injection: The recommended adult dose is 40 mg Esomeprazole given once daily by intravenous injection (not less than 3 minutes) or intravenous infusion (10 to 30 minutes). Esomeprazole IV injection should not be administered concomitantly with any other medications through the same intravenous site. Treatment with Esomeprazole IV injection should be discontinued as soon as the patient is able to resume treatment with Esomeprazole delayed-release capsules. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r  Administration\rEsomeprazole tablet or capsule: should be swallowed whole and taken one hour before a meal.\r Direction for use of Delayed-Release Oral Suspension: Whole contents of the packet should be taken into a small glass containing 15 ml. of water. The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r Esomeprazole IV Injection: Esomeprazole IV should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding to the vial 5 ml of the solvent (WFI) provided. After reconstitution, the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 3 minutes. The solution should be used within 12 hours of reconstitution when stored at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C. No refrigeration is required. The reconstituted solution should not be used if it contains visible particulate.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEsomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomeprazole.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of esomeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esomeprazole include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esomeprazole capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esomeprazole capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking esomeprazole.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esomeprazole in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esomeprazole is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esomeprazole. No specific antidote for Esomeprazole is known. Since Esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rReconstitution\rInfusion: Reconstitute one sterile single-dose vial of Esomeprazole IV Injection with 5 ml of the solvent (WFI) provided and further diluting the resulting solution within 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to make a final volume of 50 ml. The resultant infusion should be given intravenously over a period of 10-30 minutes. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 12 hours after reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or for 6 hours after reconstitution with 5% Dextrose solution. From a microbial point of view, the product should be used immediately. Any unused portion should be discarded.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that iMAX MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that iMAX MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r iMAX MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major iMAX MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of iMAX MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. iMAX MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, iMAX MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of iMAX MUPS.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of iMAX MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of iMAX MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with iMAX MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\riMAX MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like iMAX MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that iMAX MUPS is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that iMAX MUPS does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \niMAX MUPS may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major iMAX MUPS metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of iMAX MUPS 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. iMAX MUPS inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, iMAX MUPS may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of iMAX MUPS.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of iMAX MUPS, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of iMAX MUPS and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with iMAX MUPS include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\niMAX MUPS should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like iMAX MUPS may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\r\nCommon Questions about iMAX MUPS 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is iMAX MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table?\r\niMAX MUPS 20 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

        "description": "Indications\rGavilac is indicated in-\rGastric reflux\rHeartburn\rIndigestion\rFlatulence associated with gastric reflux\rHeartburn of pregnancy\rAll cases of epigastric and retrosternal distress where the underlying cause is gastric reflux.\rPharmacology\rThis is the combination of two antacids (Calcium carbonate and Sodium bicarbonate) and an alginate (Sodium alginate). The suspension work in two ways-\rNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\rForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\rThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\rDosage & Administration\rFor oral suspension:\rAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\rElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\rChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed. Recommended dose:\rAdults and children 12 years and over: Take two to four tablets after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 12 years: Tablets should be given only on medical advice.\r Hepatic Impairment: No dose modification necessary.\rRenal Insufficiency: Caution if highly restricted salt diet is necessary.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rA time-interval of 2 hours should be considered between Gavilac intake and the administration of other medicinal products, especially Tetracyclines, Digoxine, Fluoroquinolone, Iron salt, Ketoconazole, Neuroleptics, Thyroid Hormones, Penicillamine, beta-blockers (Atenolol, Metoprolol, Propranolol), Glucocorticoid, Chloroquine and Biphosphonates (diphosphonates) and Estramustine.\rContraindications\rThis product is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rIn addition to the desired effect of the drug, some side effects may appear such as: constipation, flatulence, stomach cramp or belching. In these cases consult a physician. If too big dose has been taken, there might appear a sensation of swelling. In this case, it is advisable to consult a physician.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Clinical studies in more than 500 pregnant women, as well as a large amount of data from post-marketing experience, indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of the active ingredients. This drug can be used during pregnancy, if clinically needed.\r Breastfeeding: No effects of the active substances have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants of treated mothers. This drug can be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: Pre-clinical investigations have revealed Alginate has no negative effect on parental or offspring fertility or reproduction. Clinical data do not suggest that this drug has an effect on human fertility.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEach 20 ml of dose has a sodium content of 254.5 mg (11.06 mmol). This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g. in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment.\r Each 20 ml contains 260 mg (6.5 mmol) of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis, and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi.\r Treatment of children younger than 12 years of age is not generally recommended, except on medical advice.\r Gavilac is considered high in sodium. This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g., in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment. Each tablet contains 75 mg of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi. Due to its aspartame content Gavilac should not be given to patients with phenylketonuria. If symptoms persist, or treatment is required for more than 7 days continuously, medical advice should be sought. Taking Gavilac can mask the symptoms of other more serious, underlying medical conditions. It should not be used in patients with impaired renal function/insufficiency and with hypophosphatemia. This may cause allergic reactions.\rOverdose Effects\rIn the event of over dosage symptomatic treatment should be given. The patient may notice abdominal distension.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntacids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool (below 30\u00b0C) and dry place, away from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not refrigerate or freeze.\rCommon Questions about Gavilac 250 mg Chewable Tablet\rWhat is Gavilac 250 mg Chew. Tablet?\rGavilac 250 mg Chew. Tablet is the combination of two antacids and an alginate. This is commonly used to treat Gastric reflux, Heartburn, Indigestion, Flatulence associated with gastric reflux.\rIs Gavilac 250 mg Chew. Tablet safe in pregnancy?\rYou can take Gavilac 250 mg Chew. Tablet if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\nIndications\r\nGavilac is indicated in-\r\nGastric reflux\r\nHeartburn\r\nIndigestion\r\nFlatulence associated with gastric reflux\r\nHeartburn of pregnancy\r\nAll cases of epigastric and retrosternal distress where the underlying cause is gastric reflux.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis is the combination of two antacids (Calcium carbonate and Sodium bicarbonate) and an alginate (Sodium alginate). The suspension work in two ways-\r\nNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\r\nForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\r\nThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor oral suspension:\r\nAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\r\nChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\r\nChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\r\nElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\r\nChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed.

        "description": "Indications\rRasonix Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rFinix - MedEx campaign banner\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rasonix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rasonix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rasonix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rasonix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rasonix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rasonix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rasonix is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rasonix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rasonix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rasonix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rasonix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rasonix with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Rasonix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rasonix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Rasonix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rasonix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\r\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\r\nPatients should be cautioned that Rasonix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\r\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Rasonix is not recommended.\r\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\r\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r\n \nInfluence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rasonix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r\n \nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rasonix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nInterference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rasonix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric populations: Rasonix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rasonix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rApuldon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r\n \nThe usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\r\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\r\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\r\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\r\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\r\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\r\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\r\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\r\nContraindications\r\nDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nApuldon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rAmaryl is indicated in following conditions-\rAmaryl is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower the blood glucose in patients with noninsulin dependent (Type II) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose hyperglycaemia cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone.\rAmaryl may be used concomitantly with metformin when diet, exercise, and Amaryl or metformin alone does not result in adequate glycaemic control.\rAmaryl is also indicated for use in combination with insulin to lower blood glucose in patients whose hyperglycaemia cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycaemic agent.\rCombined use of Amaryl and insulin may increase the potential for hypoglycaemia.\rPharmacology\rGlimepiride is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent which decreases blood glucose concentration. The primary mechanism of action of Glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of beta cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion. In addition, extrapancreatic effects like reduction of basal hepatic glucose production, increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake may also play role in the activity of Glimepiride. In non-fasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of Glimepiride persists for 24 hours.\rDosage\rIn principle, the dosage of Glimepiride is governed by the desired blood sugar level. The dosage of Glimepiride must be the lowest which is sufficient to achieve the desired metabolic control. The initial and the maintenance doses are set based on the results of regular check of glucose in blood and urine. Monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine also serves to detect either primary or secondary failure of therapy.\r Initial dose and dose titration: the usual initial dose is 1 mg once daily, if necessary, the daily dose can be increased. Any increase can be based on regular blood sugar monitoring, and should be gradual, i.e., at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks, and carried out stepwise, as follows: 1 mg -> 2 mg -> 3 mg -> 4 mg -> 6 mg.\r Dose in patients with well controlled diabetes: the usual dose range in patients with well controlled diabetes is 1 to 4 mg daily.\r Distribution of doses: Timing and distribution of doses are decided by the physician, in consideration of the patient's current life-style. Normally, a single daily dose is sufficient. This should be taken immediately before a substantial breakfast or if none is taken immediately before the first main meal. It is very important not to skip meals after taking the drug.\r Secondary dosage adjustment: As control of diabetes improves, sensitivity to insuiin increases; therefore, Glimepiride requirement may fall as treatment proceeds. To avoid hypoglycaemia, timely dose reduction or cessation of Glimepiride therapy must be considered. A dose adjustment must also be considered whenever the patient's weight or life-styie changes, or other factors arise which cause an increased susceptibility to hypo or hyperglycaemia.\r Changeover from other oral antidiabetics to Glimepiride: There is no exact dosage relationship between Glimepiride and other oral blood sugar lowering agents. When substituting Glimepiride for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeover from maximum dose of other oral blood sugar lowering agents. Any dose increase should be in accordance with guideline given above in 'initial dose and dose titration'. Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar lowering agent. It may be necessary to interrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rGlimepiride tablet must be swallowed with sufficient amount of liquid.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBased on experience with Amaryl and known interactions for other sulfonylureas, the following interactions must be considered.\r In addition to insulin and other oral antidiabetic agents, drugs which may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of Amaryl include: ACE inhibitors, aminosalicylic acid, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, azapropazone, chloramphenicol, ciofibrate, coumarin derivatives, cyclophosphamide, disopyramide, fenfluramine, fenyramidol, fibrates, fluconazole, fluoxetine, guanethidine, ifosfamide, MAO-inhibitors, miconazole, oxpentifylline (high dose parenteral), oxyphenbutazone, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, probenecid, quinolones, salicylates, sulphinpyrazone, sulfonamide antibiotics, tetracyclines, tritoqualine, trofosfamide.\r Drugs which may attenuate the hypoglycaemic action of Amaryl include:\rAcetazoiamide, barbiturates, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, laxatives, nicotinic acid (high doses), oestrogens, phenothiazines, phenytoin, progestagens, rifampicin, sympathomimetic agents, thyroid hormones.\rH2 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect.\rConcomitant treatment with a beta-receptor blocker, clonidine, guanethidine or reserpine may mask the warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemic attack.\rAcute and chronic aicohol intake may either potentiate or attenuate the activity of Amaryl in an unpredictable fashion.\rContraindications\rGlimepiride is not suitable for the treatment of insulin dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus, or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, nor for the treatment of diabetic coma. Glimepiride must not be used in patients hypersensitive to Glimepiride, other sulfonylureas, other sulfonamides, severe hepatic dysfunction, severe impairment of renal function and dialysis patients.\rSide Effects\rHypoglycaemia, temporary visual impairment, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urticaria, fall in blood pressure.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rGlimepiride must not be taken during pregnancy; a changeover to insulin is necessary. Patients planning a pregnancy must inform their physician, and should change over to insulin. Ingestion of Glimepiride with breast milk feeding may harm the child. Therefore, Glimepiride must not be taken by breastfeeding women. Either a changeover or complete discontinuation of breastfeeding is necessary.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rin the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycaemia may be increased and necessitates careful monitoring. If such risk present it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of Amaryl, Hypoglycaemia can almost be promptly controlled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (glucose or sugar).\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage of sulfonylureas, including Amaryl, can produce hypoglycaemia. Mild hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medicai emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycaemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of  concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dl. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.\rTherapeutic Class\rSulfonylureas\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

When substituting Glimepiride for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeover from maximum dose of other oral blood sugar lowering agents. Any dose increase should be in accordance with guideline given above in 'initial dose and dose titration'. Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar lowering agent. It may be necessary to interrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nGlimepiride tablet must be swallowed with sufficient amount of liquid.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nBased on experience with Amaryl and known interactions for other sulfonylureas, the following interactions must be considered.\r\n \nIn addition to insulin and other oral antidiabetic agents, drugs which may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of Amaryl include: ACE inhibitors, aminosalicylic acid, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, azapropazone, chloramphenicol, ciofibrate, coumarin derivatives, cyclophosphamide, disopyramide, fenfluramine, fenyramidol, fibrates, fluconazole, fluoxetine, guanethidine, ifosfamide, MAO-inhibitors, miconazole, oxpentifylline (high dose parenteral), oxyphenbutazone, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, probenecid, quinolones, salicylates, sulphinpyrazone, sulfonamide antibiotics, tetracyclines, tritoqualine, trofosfamide.\r\n \nDrugs which may attenuate the hypoglycaemic action of Amaryl include:\r\nAcetazoiamide, barbiturates, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, laxatives, nicotinic acid (high doses), oestrogens, phenothiazines, phenytoin, progestagens, rifampicin, sympathomimetic agents, thyroid hormones.\r\nH2 receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect.\r\nConcomitant treatment with a beta-receptor blocker, clonidine, guanethidine or reserpine may mask the warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemic attack.\r\nAcute and chronic aicohol intake may either potentiate or attenuate the activity of Amaryl in an unpredictable fashion.\r\nContraindications\r\nGlimepiride is not suitable for the treatment of insulin dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus, or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis, nor for the treatment of diabetic coma. Glimepiride must not be used in patients hypersensitive to Glimepiride, other sulfonylureas, other sulfonamides, severe hepatic dysfunction, severe impairment of renal function and dialysis patients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nHypoglycaemia, temporary visual impairment, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urticaria, fall in blood pressure.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nGlimepiride must not be taken during pregnancy; a changeover to insulin is necessary. Patients planning a pregnancy must inform their physician, and should change over to insulin. Ingestion of Glimepiride with breast milk feeding may harm the child. Therefore, Glimepiride must not be taken by breastfeeding women. Either a changeover or complete discontinuation of breastfeeding is necessary.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nin the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycaemia may be increased and necessitates careful monitoring. If such risk present it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of Amaryl, Hypoglycaemia can almost be promptly controlled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (glucose or sugar).\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nOverdosage of sulfonylureas, including Amaryl, can produce hypoglycaemia. Mild hypoglycaemic symptoms without loss of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycaemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medicai emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycaemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of  concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dl. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSulfonylureas\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Progut is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Progut does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Progut may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Progut metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Progut 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Progut inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Progut may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Progut.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Progut, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Progut and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Progut include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Progut does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Progut capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Progut capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Progut.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Progut in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Progut is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Progut at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Progut. No specific antidote for Progut is known. Since Progut is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose.

As Omegut is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Omegut 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Omegut 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Omegut and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Omegut is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Omegut and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rOmegut is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Omegut as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Omegut.

Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 2 mg once daily with or without food, at any time of the day. Due to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the daily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy.\r Older people: Start with 1 mg once daily; if needed the dose can be increased to 2 mg once daily.\r Children: Prucalopride should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIn-vitro data indicate that, Laxopride has a low interaction potential and therapeutic concentrations of Laxopride are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co medicated medicinal products. Although Laxopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations.\r Ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.\r Studies in healthy subjects showed that, there were no clinically relevant effects of Laxopride on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, paroxetine or oral contraceptives.\rContraindications\rPrucalopride is contraindicated in those people who are hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients and people with renal impairment requiring dialysis.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Laxopride therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain), nausea and diarrhoea. The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPrucalopride is not recommended during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition, or postnatal development. In the absence of human data, it is not recommended to use Prucalopride during breastfeeding\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. A dose of 1 mg is recommended in subjects with severe renal impairment.\rCaution should be exercised when prescribing Laxopride to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rIn case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception.\rThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal Impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start with 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg dose is well tolerated. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride's known pharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not available for Laxopride overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances.\rTherapeutic Class\rOsmotic purgatives\rStorage Conditions\rStore at room temperature, below 30\u00b0C. Do not remove desiccant.

Due to the specific mode of action of prucalopride (stimulation of propulsive motility), exceeding the daily dose of 2 mg is not expected to increase efficacy.\r\n \nOlder people: Start with 1 mg once daily; if needed the dose can be increased to 2 mg once daily.\r\n \nChildren: Prucalopride should not be used in children and adolescents younger than 18 years\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nIn-vitro data indicate that, Laxopride has a low interaction potential and therapeutic concentrations of Laxopride are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co medicated medicinal products. Although Laxopride may be a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations.\r\n \nKetoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of P-gp, increased the systemic exposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant. Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P-gp such as verapamil, cyclosporine A and quinidine.\r\n \nStudies in healthy subjects showed that, there were no clinically relevant effects of Laxopride on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, paroxetine or oral contraceptives.\r\nContraindications\r\nPrucalopride is contraindicated in those people who are hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients and people with renal impairment requiring dialysis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with Laxopride therapy are headache (17.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain), nausea and diarrhoea. The adverse reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. Other adverse reactions have been reported occasionally. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPrucalopride is not recommended during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition, or postnatal development. In the absence of human data, it is not recommended to use Prucalopride during breastfeeding\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride. A dose of 1 mg is recommended in subjects with severe renal impairment.\r\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Laxopride to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) due to limited data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\nIn case of severe diarrhoea, the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced and the use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception.\r\nThe tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal Impairment: The dose for patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) is 1 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) start with 1 mg once daily which may be increased to 2 mg if required to improve efficacy and if the 1 mg dose is well tolerated. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAn overdose may result in symptoms resulting from an exaggeration of prucalopride's known pharmacodynamic effects and include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Specific treatment is not available for Laxopride overdose. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Extensive fluid loss by diarrhoea or vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOsmotic purgatives\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at room temperature, below 30\u00b0C. Do not remove desiccant. Dispense in original bottle.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.\rPharmacology\rVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.\r Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Glucomin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, this combination may be initiated at twice daily, 1 tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. Taking this combination with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when Vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was co-administered with Metformin Hydrochloride (1,000 mg once daily). Vildagliptin has a low potential for drug interactions. Since Vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate nor does it inhibit nor induces CYP 450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with co-medications that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. As a result of these studies no clinically relevant interactions with other oral antidiabetics (glibenclamide, pioglitazone, metformin hydrochloride), amlodipine, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, valsartan or warfarin were observed after co-administration with vildagliptin. On the other hand, furosemide, nifedipine and glyburide increase Cmax and blood AUC of Metformin with no change in renal clearance of Metformin.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are headache, tremor, dizziness, nausea, hypoglycaemia etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women and therefore, this combination should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. No studies have been conducted with the components of this combination. As it is not known whether Vildagliptin and/or Metformin Hydrochloride is excreted in human milk this combination should not be administered to breast-feeding women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least once a year in patients with normal renal function and 2\u20134 times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of normal and in elderly patients. Special caution should be exercised in elderly patients where renal function may become impaired (e.g. when initiating antihypertensives, diuretics or NSAIDs). It is recommended that Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are monitored prior to initiation of Viptin Plus, at three-monthly intervals in the first year and periodically thereafter. If transaminase levels are increased, patients should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality return to normal. If AST or ALT persist at 3 x ULN, Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be stopped Patients who develop jaundice or other signs of liver dysfunction. Following withdrawal of treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin and LFT normalization, treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin should not be reinitiated. Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of Viptin Plus in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, Viptin Plus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.\r Use in geriatric patients: As Metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal function, elderly patients taking Viptin Plus should have their renal function monitored regularly. Viptin Plus should only be used in elderly patients with normal renal function.\r Patients with renal impairment: Viptin Plus should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dl (>135 micro mol/L) in males and > 1.4 mg/dl (>110 micro mol/L) in females.\r Patients with hepatic impairment: Viptin Plus is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST >3 X the upper limit of normal.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombination Oral hypoglycemic preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDomilux should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r\n \nThe usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\r\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\r\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\r\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\r\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\r\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\r\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\r\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\r\nContraindications\r\nDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nDomilux should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rRabemax Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rFinix - MedEx campaign banner\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rabemax with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Rabemax is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabemax may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Rabemax does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rabemax 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Rabemax gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rabemax 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Rabemax is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rabemax, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rabemax. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rabemax 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Rabemax is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rabemax is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Rabemax 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Rabemax 20 mg Tablet?\rRabemax 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Rabemax 20 mg Tablet used for?\rRabemax 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Rabemax 20 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Rabemax 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Rabemax with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Rabemax is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Rabemax may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Rabemax does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Rabemax 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\r\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\r\nPatients should be cautioned that Rabemax gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Rabemax 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\r\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Rabemax is not recommended.\r\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\r\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r\n \nInfluence on vitamin B12 absorption: Rabemax, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r\n \nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Rabemax. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nInterference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Rabemax 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric populations: Rabemax is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Rabemax is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Rabemax 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Rabemax 20 mg Tablet?\r\nRabemax 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\r\nWhat is Rabemax 20 mg Tablet used for?\r\nRabemax 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\r\nWhat are the side effects of Rabemax 20 mg Tablet?\r\nThe most common side effects of Rabemax 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

        "description": "Indications\rEsomeprazole is indicated:\rTo relieve from chronic heartburn symptoms and other symptoms associated with GERD\rFor the healing of erosive esophagitis\rFor maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis\rIn combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rAcid related Dyspepsia\rDuodenal & Gastric ulcer\rCampaign Banner\rPharmacology\rEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole (S-isomer of omeprazole) is the first single optical isomer of proton pump inhibitor, provides better acid control than racemic proton pump inhibitors.\r Absorption: Esomeprazole capsules contain an enteric-coated pellet formulation of esomeprazole magnesium. After oral administration peak plasma levels (Cmax) occur at approximately 1.5 hours (Tmax). The Cmax increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 to 40 mg. At repeated once daily dosing, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose. The AUC after administration of a single dose of esomeprazole is decreased by 33-53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions. Esomeprazole should be taken at least one hour before meals.\r Distribution: Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 20 mmol/L. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy volunteers is approximately 16 L.\r Metabolism: Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole\u2019s metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.\r Excretion: The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1\u20131.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the faeces.\r Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials: Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily is given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The mean steady state AUC and Cmax of Esomeprazole increased by 70% and 18%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with Esomeprazole alone. The pharmacokinetic parameters for clarithromycin and amoxicillin are similar during triple combination therapy and administration of each drug alone. However, the mean AUC and Cmax for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin are increased by 19% and 22%, respectively, during triple combination therapy compared to treatment with clarithromycin alone. This increase in exposure to 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not considered to be clinically significant.\rDosage\rHealing of Erosive Esophagitis: 20 mg or 40 mg Once Daily for 4-8 Weeks. The majority of patients are healed within 4 to 8 weeks. For patients who don't heal after 4-8 weeks, an additional 4-8 weeks of treatment may be considered. Maintenance of Healing of Erosive\r Esophagitis: 20 mg Once Daily (Clinical studies did not extend 6 months).\r Symptomatic GERD: 20 mg Once Daily for 4 Weeks. If symptoms do not resolve completely after 4 weeks, an additional 4 weeks of treatment may be considered.\r Helicobacter Pylori eradication: Triple Therapy to reduce the risk of Duodenal Ulcer recurrence-Esomeprazole 40 mg Once Daily for 10 days, Amoxicillin 1000 mg Twice Daily for 10 days, Clarithromycin 500 mg Twice Daily for 10 days.\r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The dose is 20-80 mg once daily. The dosage should be adjusted individually and treatment continued as long as clinically indicated.\r Acid-related Dyspepsia: 20-40 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks according to the response.\r Duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks. Gastric ulcer: 20-40 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.\r Injection: The recommended adult dose is 40 mg Esomeprazole given once daily by intravenous injection (not less than 3 minutes) or intravenous infusion (10 to 30 minutes). Esomeprazole IV injection should not be administered concomitantly with any other medications through the same intravenous site. Treatment with Esomeprazole IV injection should be discontinued as soon as the patient is able to resume treatment with Esomeprazole delayed-release capsules. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r  Administration\rEsomeprazole tablet or capsule: should be swallowed whole and taken one hour before a meal.\r Direction for use of Delayed-Release Oral Suspension: Whole contents of the packet should be taken into a small glass containing 15 ml. of water. The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r Esomeprazole IV Injection: Esomeprazole IV should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding to the vial 5 ml of the solvent (WFI) provided. After reconstitution, the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 3 minutes. The solution should be used within 12 hours of reconstitution when stored at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C. No refrigeration is required. The reconstituted solution should not be used if it contains visible particulate.\r Interaction\rEsomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomeprazole.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of esomeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esomeprazole include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esomeprazole capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esomeprazole capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking esomeprazole.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esomeprazole in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esomeprazole is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esomeprazole. No specific antidote for Esomeprazole is known. Since Esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rReconstitution\rInfusion: Reconstitute one sterile single-dose vial of Esomeprazole IV Injection with 5 ml of the solvent (WFI) provided and further diluting the resulting solution within 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to make a final volume of 50 ml. The resultant infusion should be given intravenously over a period of 10-30 minutes. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 12 hours after reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or for 6 hours after reconstitution with 5% Dextrose solution. From a microbial point of view, the product should be used immediately. Any unused portion should be discarded.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\nIndications\r\nEsomeprazole is indicated:\r\nTo relieve from chronic heartburn symptoms and other symptoms associated with GERD\r\nFor the healing of erosive esophagitis\r\nFor maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis\r\nIn combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with duodenal ulcer disease.\r\nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\r\nAcid related Dyspepsia\r\nDuodenal & Gastric ulcer\r\nCampaign Banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nEsomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esomeprazole is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esomeprazole does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nEsomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esomeprazole 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esomeprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esomeprazole.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of esomeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esomeprazole include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esomeprazole capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esomeprazole capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking esomeprazole.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esomeprazole in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esomeprazole is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esomeprazole. No specific antidote for Esomeprazole is known. Since Esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nReconstitution\r\nInfusion: Reconstitute one sterile single-dose vial of Esomeprazole IV Injection with 5 ml of the solvent (WFI) provided and further diluting the resulting solution within 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to make a final volume of 50 ml. The resultant infusion should be given intravenously over a period of 10-30 minutes. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 12 hours after reconstitution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or for 6 hours after reconstitution with 5% Dextrose solution. From a microbial point of view, the product should be used immediately. Any unused portion should be discarded.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDomilin should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

In doing so, it increases intestinal motility, thus aiding the passage of stool and relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation.\r Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.\rDosage & Administration\rIrritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation: The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.\r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily. If tolerated then dose can be increased to 8 mcg twice \r Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Opioid-induced Constipation: The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water. \r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily.

It is not known whether lubiprostone is excreted in human milk. Because lubiprostone increases fluid secretion in the intestine and intestinal motility, human milk-fed infants should be monitored for diarrhea.

Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation: The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.\r\n \nDosage in patients with hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily. If tolerated then dose can be increased to 8 mcg twice \r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Constipation and Opioid-induced Constipation: The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water. \r\n \nDosage in patients with hepatic impairment: For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nThere is a possibility of a dose-dependent decrease in the efficacy of Lubilax in patients using diphenylheptane opioids.\r\nContraindications\r\nLubiprostone is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDiarrhea, full or bloated feeling or pressure in the stomach, nausea, stomach pain, swelling of abdominal or stomach area, Dyspnea\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category C. It is not known whether lubiprostone is excreted in human milk. Because lubiprostone increases fluid secretion in the intestine and intestinal motility, human milk-fed infants should be monitored for diarrhea.

        "description": " Indications\rXorel Gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for the treatment of:\rActive duodenal ulcer\rActive benign gastric ulcer\rSymptomatic erosive or ulcerative gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).\rGastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance)\rSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe gastro-esophageal reflux disease (symptomatic GERD)\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\rIn combination with appropriate antibacterial therapeutic regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients with peptic ulcer disease.\rFinix - MedEx campaign banner\rParicel - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Xorel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Xorel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Xorel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Xorel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Xorel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Xorel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Xorel is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Xorel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Xorel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Xorel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Xorel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Xorel 20 mg Capsule\rWhat is Xorel 20 mg Capsule?\rXorel 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Xorel 20 mg Capsule used for?\rXorel 20 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Xorel 20 mg Capsule?\rThe most common side effects of Xorel 20 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

In doing so, it increases intestinal motility, thus aiding the passage of stool and relieve the symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation.\r Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.\rDosage & Administration\rIrritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation: The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.\r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function. For patients with severely impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily. If tolerated then dose can be increased to 8 mcg twice \r Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Opioid-induced Constipation: The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water. \r Dosage in patients with hepatic impairment: For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function, the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Xorel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Xorel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Xorel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Xorel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Xorel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Xorel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Xorel is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Xorel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Xorel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Xorel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Xorel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Xorel 20 mg Tablet\rWhat is Xorel 20 mg Tablet?\rXorel 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Xorel 20 mg Tablet used for?\rXorel 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Xorel 20 mg Tablet?\rThe most common side effects of Xorel 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. An interaction with a compound whose absorption is pH dependent may occur. Co-administration of Xorel with ketoconazole or itraconazole may result in a significant decrease in antifungal plasma levels. Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn general, Xorel is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Xorel may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSymptomatic response to therapy with Xorel does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Xorel 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\r\nPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\nProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\r\nA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\r\nPatients should be cautioned that Xorel gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r\nThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\r\nNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\r\nCo-administration of atazanavir with Xorel is not recommended.\r\nTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\r\nHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r\n \nInfluence on vitamin B12 absorption: Xorel, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r\n \nSubacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Xorel. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r\n \nInterference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Xorel 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric populations: Xorel is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Xorel is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nProton Pump Inhibitor\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Xorel 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Xorel 20 mg Tablet?\r\nXorel 20 mg Tablet is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\r\nWhat is Xorel 20 mg Tablet used for?\r\nXorel 20 mg Tablet is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\r\nWhat are the side effects of Xorel 20 mg Tablet?\r\nThe most common side effects of Xorel 20 mg Tablet are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

The suspension work in two ways-\rNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\rForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\rThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\rGaviraft - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rFor oral suspension:\rAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\rElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\rChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Prolok treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Prolok is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Prolok 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Prolok 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Prolok and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Prolok is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Prolok and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rProlok is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Prolok as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Prolok. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant woman. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pantoprazole has been shown to be excreted in human milk. So, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be cautioned that Pantolok tablet should not be split, chewed or crushed. Long-term therapy of Pantolok may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) or may increase the risk of osteoporosis related disorders.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no known symptoms of overdosage in humans. Since Pantolok is highly protein bound, it is not readily dialyzable. Apart from symptomatic and supportive management, no specific therapy is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rReconstitution\rDirection for use of IV injection: Pantolok lyophilized powder and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sompraz is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sompraz does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sompraz may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sompraz metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sompraz 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sompraz inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sompraz may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sompraz.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sompraz, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sompraz and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sompraz include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sompraz does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sompraz capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sompraz capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sompraz.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sompraz in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sompraz is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sompraz at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sompraz. No specific antidote for Sompraz is known. Since Sompraz is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Therefore, Sompraz may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sompraz.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sompraz, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sompraz and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sompraz include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sompraz does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Sompraz capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sompraz capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sompraz.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sompraz in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sompraz is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Sompraz at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sompraz. No specific antidote for Sompraz is known. Since Sompraz is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSompraz is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Sompraz is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Sompraz does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Sompraz may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Sompraz metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Sompraz 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Sompraz inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Sompraz may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Sompraz.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Sompraz, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Sompraz and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Sompraz include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Sompraz does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Sompraz capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Sompraz capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Sompraz.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Sompraz in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Sompraz is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Sompraz at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Sompraz. No specific antidote for Sompraz is known. Since Sompraz is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

Famotidine completely inhibits the action of histamine on H2- receptors of parietal cell. It inhibits basal, overnight and pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion. The H2- receptor antagonist activity of Famotidine is slowly reversible, since the drug dissociates slowly from H2-receptor.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rFor gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, anastomotic ulcer, upper gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, reflux esophagitis and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: Usual dose for adults: Famotidine 20 mg twice daily (after breakfast and after supper or before bed time) or Famotidine 40 mg can be administered orally once daily at bed time.\rFor the treatment of acute gastritis, chronic gastritis in acute exacerbation stage: Usual dosage for adults is Famotidine 20 mg orally twice a day (after breakfast and after supper or before bed time). Also Famotidine 40 mg can be orally administered once a day (before bed time), dosage should be adjusted according to age and symptoms. Most ulcer patients heal within 4-8 weeks. For maintenance therapy the recommended oral dose is 20 mg once daily. Or, as directed by the registered physician.\r Powder for Suspension: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD):\r<1 year of age: 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension up to 8 weeks once daily in patients\rAge 3 to 11 months: 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily up to 8 weeks\rAge 1 to 2 months: 0.5 mg/kg/dose once daily up to 8 weeks\rNeonates: 0.5 mg/kg/dose maximum once daily up to 8 weeks\rPatients 1-16 years of age:\rGastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD): 1 mg/kg/day p.o. divided b.i.d. up to 40 mg b.i.d.\rDuodonal ulcer: 0.5 mg/kg/day p.o. at bedtime or divided b.i.d. up to 40 mg/day.\rPeptic ulcer: 0.5 mg/kg/day p.o. at bedtime or divided b.i.d. up to 40 mg/day.\rMaintenance therapy: 40 mg at daily night.\rReflux esophagitis: 2 mg/kg/day\rZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: 40 mg 3 times daily.\rIntravenous Injection: In some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication, Famotidine Injection Premixed or Famotidine Injection may be administered until oral therapy can be instituted. The recommended dosage for Famotidine Injection Premixed and Famotidine Injection in adult patients is 20 mg intravenously q 12 h. The doses and regimen for parenteral administration in patients with GERD have not been established.\r Dosage for Pediatric Patients: Pediatric Patients suggest that the starting dose in pediatric patients 1-16 years of age is 0.25 mg/kg intravenously (injected over a period of not less than two minutes or as a 15-minute infusion) q 12 h up to 40 mg/day. While published uncontrolled clinical studies suggest the effectiveness of famotidine in the treatment of peptic ulcer, data in pediatric patients are insufficient to establish percent response with dose and duration of therapy. Therefore, treatment duration (initially based on adult duration recommendations) and dose should be individualized based on clinical response and/or gastric pH determination and endoscopy. Published uncontrolled studies in pediatric patients have demonstrated gastric acid suppression with doses up to 0.5 mg/kg intravenously q 12 h. No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data are available on pediatric patients under 1 year of age.\r Interaction\rNo clinically important drug interactions have been identified. Famotidine does not interact with the cytochrome P450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of the drug.\rSide Effects\rEruption, constipation, diarrhoea, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, high blood pressure, headache, drowsiness or insomnia may rarely occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B.

Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rEsolok is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolok is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolok does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Esolok may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolok metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolok 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolok inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolok may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolok.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolok, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolok and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esolok include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esolok does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Esolok capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esolok capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esolok.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esolok in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esolok is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Esolok at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esolok. No specific antidote for Esolok is known. Since Esolok is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nEsolok is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Esolok is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Esolok does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nEsolok may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Esolok metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Esolok 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Esolok inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Esolok may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Esolok.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Esolok, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Esolok and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Esolok include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Esolok does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r\n \nInformation for patients: Esolok capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Esolok capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Esolok.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Esolok in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Esolok is excreted unchanged in the urine.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nA single oral dose of Esolok at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Esolok. No specific antidote for Esolok is known. Since Esolok is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place. Protect from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.

The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDon-A should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r\n \nThe usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.

The mixer should be stirred well and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Stir again and drink within 30 minutes. If any medicine remains after drinking, add more water, stir, and drink immediately. If the suspension is to be administered through a nasogastric or gastric tube, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 ml. & immediately shake the syringe and leave 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe and inject it through the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach within 30 minutes. An appropriately sized syringe should be used. Shake and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.\r IV Injection: Solution for injection is prepared by adding 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for intravenous injection into the vial containing the dry powder. The reconstituted solution for injection is clear and colorless to very slightly yellow. IV injection must be administrated intravenously over a period of at least 3 minutes. Prepared solution must be used within 12 hours of preparation and can be exposed to normal indoor lighting at a maximum of 30\u00b0C.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMaxpro is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Maxpro is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that Maxpro does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r Maxpro may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major Maxpro metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of Maxpro 30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. Maxpro inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Maxpro may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of Maxpro.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of Maxpro, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of Maxpro and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in-patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with Maxpro include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effects. The excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. Breast-feeding should be therefore be discontinued if the use of esomeprazole is considered essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Symptomatic response to therapy with Maxpro does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\r Information for patients: Maxpro capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the Maxpro capsules can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellet/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. Antacids may be used while taking Maxpro.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety and efficacy have been observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. However, in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, a dose of 20 mg once daily should not be exceeded.\r Renal Insufficiency: The Pharmacokinetics of Maxpro in patients with renal impairment are not expected to be altered relative to healthy volunteers as less than 1% of Maxpro is excreted unchanged in the urine.\rOverdose Effects\rA single oral dose of Maxpro at 510 mg/kg (about 103 times the human dose on a body surface area basis), has been lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity are reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. There have been no reports of overdose with Maxpro. No specific antidote for Maxpro is known. Since Maxpro is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered.\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature not exceeding 30\u00b0C in a dry place.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\rDosage\rActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r Erosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r Symptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r Treatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r Eradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance. Patients should be cautioned that the Rabeprazole tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRespite produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

Therefore individual patients may need to be monitored to determine if a dosage adjustment is necessary when ketoconazole or itraconazole are taken concomitantly with Respite. No interaction with liquid antacids was observed. The absorption of atazanavir is pH-dependent. Therefore PPIs, including rabeprazole, should not be co-administered with atazanavir.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Rabeprazole is contra-indicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.\rSide Effects\rIn general, Finix is well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term studies. Finix may sometimes cause headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, increased or decreased appetite, muscle pain, drowsiness, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUS FDA pregnancy category 'C'. Studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Rabeprazole. There are however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Rabeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSymptomatic response to therapy with Finix does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Finix 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets.\rPatients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\rProton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10\u201340%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium.\rA risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.\rPatients should be cautioned that Finix gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole.\rThere have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rHepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole.\rNo evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients.\rCo-administration of atazanavir with Finix is not recommended.\rTreatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile.\rHypomagnesaemia: Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment.\r Influence on vitamin B12 absorption: Finix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed.\r Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE): Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Finix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors.\r Interference with laboratory tests: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Finix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric populations: Finix is not recommended for use in children due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are  generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Finix is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC18H21N3O3S\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Rabeprazole Sodium\rCommon Questions about Finix 20 mg Capsule\rWhat is Finix 20 mg Capsule?\rFinix 20 mg Capsule is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion.\rWhat is Finix 20 mg Capsule used for?\rFinix 20 mg Capsule is used to treat in Duodenal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, GERD, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Helicobacter pylori eradication\rWhat are the side effects of Finix 20 mg Capsule?\rThe most common side effects of Finix 20 mg Capsule are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor.\r\nDosage\r\nActive Duodenal Ulcer and Active Benign Gastric Ulcer: The recommended oral dose for both bioactive duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer is 20 mg to be taken once daily in the morning. Most patients with active duodenal ulcer heal within four weeks. However, a few patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy to achieve healing. Most patients with active benign gastric ulcer heal within six weeks. However, again a few patients may require an additional six weeks of therapy to achieve healing.\r\n \nErosive or Ulcerative Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The recommended oral dose for this condition is 20 mg to be taken once daily for four to eight weeks.\r\n \nGastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease Long-term Management (GERD Maintenance): For long-term management, a maintenance dose of rabeprazole sodium 20 mg or 10 mg once daily can be used depending upon patient response.\r\n \nSymptomatic treatment of moderate to very severe Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD): 10 mg once daily in patients without oesophagitis. If symptom control has not been achieved during four weeks, the patient should be further investigated. Once symptoms have resolved, subsequent symptom control can be achieved using an on-demand regimen taking 10 mg once daily when needed.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (Less than 15 kg): 5 mg once daily for 12 weeks with the option to increase to 10 mg if inadequate response.\r\n \nTreatment of GERD in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age (15 kg or more): 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks. \r\n \nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome: The recommended adult starting dose is 60 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated upwards to 120 mg/day based on individual patient needs. Single daily doses up to 100 mg/day may be given. 120 mg dose may require divided doses, 60 mg twice daily. Treatment should continue for as long as clinically indicated.\r\n \nEradication of H. pylori: Patients with H. pylori infection should be treated with eradication therapy. The following combination given for 7 days is recommended. Rabeprazole sodium 20 mg twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1g twice daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nFor indications requiring once-daily treatment Rabeprazole tablets should be taken in the morning, before eating; and although neither the time of day nor food intake was shown to have any effect on rabeprazole sodium activity, this regimen will facilitate treatment compliance.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParidon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r\n \nThe usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\r\nChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn dyspeptic symptom:\r\nAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\r\nIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\r\nAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\r\nChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\r\nBy rectum in suppositories:\r\nAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\r\nChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\r\nThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\r\nneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\r\ndopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\r\nContraindications\r\nDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nParidon should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that REMMO is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that REMMO does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r REMMO may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major REMMO metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of REMMO 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. REMMO inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, REMMO may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r Co-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of REMMO.\r Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of REMMO, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of REMMO and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\rContraindications\rEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with REMMO include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rREMMO should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like REMMO may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light.

The pellets must not be chewed or crushed.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nREMMO is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that REMMO is not likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown that REMMO does not have any clinically significant interactions with phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin.\r\n \nREMMO may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major REMMO metabolizing enzyme. Co-administration of REMMO 30 mg anddiazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of diazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. REMMO inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, REMMO may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\n \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or quinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of REMMO.\r\n \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin: Co-administration of REMMO, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the plasma levels of REMMO and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\r\nContraindications\r\nEsomeprazole is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring adverse events reported with REMMO include headache, diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. There are no difference in types of related adverse events seen during maintenance treatment upto 12 months compared to short term treatment.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe manufacturer advises caution. It is not known if Esomeprazole or its metabolites appear in human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nREMMO should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump inhibitor like REMMO may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more than one year.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place below 25\u00baC, protect from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC17H19N3O3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Esomeprazole (MUPS preparation)\r\nCommon Questions about REMMO 20 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is REMMO 20 mg MUPS Table?\r\nREMMO 20 mg MUPS Table is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

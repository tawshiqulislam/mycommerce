        "description": "Indications\rEcosprin is indicated in the following indications-\rProphylaxis against arterial occlusive events: Myocardial infarction, myocardial re-infarction, after bypass surgery, acute ischaemic stroke/TIA.\rMild to moderate pain: Headache, muscle pain, dysmenorrhoea and toothache etc.\rChronic disease accompanied by pain and inflammation: Osteoarthritis.\rAntipyretic: Cold fever and influenzae.\rPharmacology\rBy decreasing platelet aggregation, Aspirin inhibits thrombus formation on the arterial side of the circulation, where thrombi are formed by platelet aggregation and anticoagulants have little effect. Aspirin is the analgesic of choice for headache, transient musculoskeletal pain and dysmenorrhoea. It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties, which may be useful. Enteric-coated Aspirin reduces intestinal disturbance and gastrointestinal ulceration due to aspirin.\rDosage & Administration\rPain, inflammatory diseases and as antipyretic: Aspirin 300 mg 1-3 tablets 6 hourly with a maximum daily dose of 4 gm.\r Suspected acute coronary syndrome: 150 mg-300 mg immediately unless there are clear contraindications.\r After myocardial infarction: Aspirin 150 mg daily for 1 month. Long-term use of aspirin in a dose of 75 mg daily is recommended thereafter.\r Acute ischaemic stroke/Transient ischaemic stroke (TIA): The starting dose is 150 mg-300 mg daily and Aspirin 75 mg daily thereafter.\r Following bypass surgery: 75 mg-300 mg daily starting 6 hours post-procedure.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSalicylates may enhance the effect of anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemic agents, phenytoin and sodium valporate. They inhibit the uricosuric effect of probenecid and may increase the toxicity of sulphonamides. They may also precipitate bronchospasm or induce attacks of asthma in susceptible subjects.\rContraindications\rAspirin is contraindicated to the children (Reye's syndrome) less than 12 years, in breast-feeding and active peptic ulcer. It is also contraindicated in bleeding due to haemophilia, intracranial haemorrhage and other ulceration.\rSide Effects\rSide effects for the usual dosage of Ecosprin are mild including nausea, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulceration and bronchospasm etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIt is especially important not to use aspirin during the last 3 months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery. Aspirin penetrates into breast milk. So, it should be administered with caution to lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIt should be administered cautiously in asthma, uncontrolled blood pressure, and pregnant women. It should be administered with caution to patients with a nasal polyp and nasal allergy.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage produces dizziness, tinnitus, sweating, nausea and vomiting, confusion and hyperventilation. Gross overdosage may lead to CNS depression with coma, cardiovascular collapse and respiratory depression. If the overdosage is suspected, the patient should be kept under observation for at least 24 hours, as symptoms and salicylate blood levels may not become apparent for several hours.

        "description": "Indications\rFebustat tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Febustat tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Febustat on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Febustat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Febustat with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Febustat metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Febustat. Febustat can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Febustat or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Febustat. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Febustat.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Febustat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Febustat. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Febustat .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Febustat  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Febustat  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Febustat have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Febustat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Febustat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Febustat than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Febustat -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Febus .\r\n \nAntacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Febus  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Febus  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\r\nContraindications\r\nFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Febus have observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Febus. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Febus need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r\n \nCardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Febus than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r\n \nLiver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Febus -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs used in Gout\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily.

But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\rSide Effects\rSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate.

It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\rDosage & Administration\rDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r Diclofenac SR Tablet:\rAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\rChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\rElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\rDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\rAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\rChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Ace XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Ace XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace XR-containing products concurrently. Ace XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r\nAce - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nTablet:\r\nAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\r\nChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Ace XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Ace XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace XR-containing products concurrently. Ace XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Ace XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rUtramal Retard is used for the treatment of moderate to severe painful conditions. These include:\rPostoperative pain\rColic and spastic pain\rCancer pain\rJoint pain\rNeck and back pain\rPain associated with osteoporosis.\rPharmacology\rTramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic compound. It inhibits the re uptake of neurotransmitters- serotonin and noradrenaline. Thus it modifies the transmission of pain impulses by activating both descending serotonergic pathways and noradrenergic pathways involved in analgesia. The analgesic effects of Tramadol are mediated via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors and indirect modulation of central monoaminergic inhibitory pathways.\rDosage & Administration\rCapsule or Tablet: Usual doses are 50 to 100 mg every four to six hours. For acute pain an initial dose of 100 mg is required. For chronic painful conditions an initial dose of 50 mg is recommended. Subsequent doses should be 50 to 100 mg administered 4-6 hourly. The dose level and frequency of dosing will depend on the severity of the pain.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Sustained Release Capsule or Tablet: One SR capsule or tablet every 12 hours, for example first one in the morning and then at the same time in the evening. The number of capsules taken at a time will depend upon severity of pain, but it should not be taken more frequently than every 12 hours.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Injection: A dose of 50-100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hours by intramuscular or by intravenous infusion. For the treatment of postoperative pain,the initial dose is 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 10 to 20 minutes if necessary to a maximum of 250 mg in the first hour. Thereafter, doses are 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours up to a total daily dose of 600 mg.\r Suppository: Tramadol suppository should be administered rectally. For adults usual dose is 100 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride 6 hourly. In general, 400 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride (4 Tramadol suppository) per day sufficient. However, for the treatment of Cancer pain and severe pain after operations much higher daily doses can be used.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIn general, physician need not be concerned about drugs interacting with Utramal Retard. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent the only drug class not recommended for combination with Utramal Retard. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with Utramal Retard causes a significant increase in Utramal Retard metabolism and it requires to increase the dose of Utramal Retard.\rContraindications\rTramadol is contraindicated in persons having hypersensitivity to this drug. It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.\rSide Effects\rCommonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRespiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.\r Opioid dependence: Utramal Retard is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.\r Concomitant CNS depressants: Utramal Retard should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.\r Concomitant MAO inhibitors: Utramal Retard should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\r Utramal Retard should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn children from the age of 1 year Utramal Retard can be given in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight. However,suppository (100 mg Utramal Retard) should not be administered in children and adolescents below the age of 14 years. Utramal Retard 100 mg SR Capsules have not been studied in children.

It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRespiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.\r\n \nOpioid dependence: Utramal Retard is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.\r\n \nConcomitant CNS depressants: Utramal Retard should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.\r\n \nConcomitant MAO inhibitors: Utramal Retard should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\r\n \nUtramal Retard should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn children from the age of 1 year Utramal Retard can be given in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight.

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to \u03bc-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to \u03bc-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.\rDosage & Administration\rFor the management of moderate to moderately severe pain: The recommended dose is 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r In case of short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain: The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r This tablet can be administered without regard to food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rContraindications\rTramadol & Paracetamol combination tablets should not be administered to patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol, paracetamol, any other component of this product, or opioids.

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\rAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\rWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\rWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\rHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\rUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r\n \nNaproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\r\nDosage\r\nCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r\n \nRheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\r\nAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\r\nWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.

As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nNaproxen & Esomeprazole is indicated for the relief of signs & symptoms of-\r\nOsteoarthritis\r\nRheumatoid arthritis\r\nAnkylosing spondylitis &\r\nTo decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis consists of an immediate release Esomeprazole Magnesium layer & an enteric-coated Naproxen core. As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r\n \nNaproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\r\nDosage\r\nCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r\n \nRheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\r\nAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\r\nWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\nWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\r\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\r\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r\n \nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r\n \nHepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r\n \nRelated to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r\n \nManagement: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r\n \nRelated to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rXten is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of the following painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system:\rRheumatoid arthritis.\rOsteoarthritis.\rArthrosis.\rAnkylosing spondylitis.\rExtra-articular disorders, e.g. tendinitis, bursitis, periarthritis of the shoulders (shoulder-hand syndrome) or hips, strains, and sprains.\rAcute gout.\rPharmacology\rTenoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties and it also inhibits platelet aggregation. Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.\rDosage\rStandard dosage: For all indications except acute gout, a daily dosage of 20 mg should be given at the same time of day.\r In acute attacks of gout: The recommended dose for acute attacks of gout is 40 mg once daily for two days followed by 20 mg once daily for a further five days.\r In the treatment of chronic disorders: The therapeutic effect of tenoxicam is evident early in treatment but there is a progressive increase in response over time. In chronic disorders, daily doses higher than 20 mg should be avoided since this would increase the frequency and intensity of unwanted reactions without significantly increasing efficacy. For patients needing long-term treatment, a reduction to a daily oral dose of 10 mg may be tried for maintenance.\r Special dosage instructions: In principle, the above dosage recommendations also apply to elderly patients and to patients suffering from kidney or liver disease. Because of lack of clinical experience, no dosage recommendations have so far been established for children and adolescents.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThe tablets should be taken with a glass of water. It is preferable to take this medicine during or immediately after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAs in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces Xten from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of Xten. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Xten is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Xten may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Xten should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Xten and furosemide was noted, but Xten attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Xten might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Xten was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Xten and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Xten. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Xten and low molecular weight heparin.\rContraindications\rTenoxicam must not be administered to patients:\rknown to be hypersensitive to the drug;\rin whom salicylates or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria;\rsuffering or having suffered from the disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer.\rSide Effects\rBased on clinical trials including large numbers of patients, Xten proved to be well tolerated in the recommended dose. Usually, the undesirable effects reported were mild and transient. In a small proportion of patients, the interruption of treatment due to undesirable effects was necessary. Local tolerance of Xten given parenterally was good. The following undesirable effects have been reported:\r Frequency is greater than 1%-\rGastrointestinal tract: gastric, epigastric and abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea.\rCentral nervous system: dizziness, headache.\rFrequency less than 1%-\rGastrointestinal tract: constipation, diarrhea, stomatitis, gastritis, vomiting, ulcers, Gl-bleeding including hematemesis and melena.\rCentral nervous system: fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, dry mouth, vertigo.\rSkin: itching (also in the anal region after rectal administration), erythema, exanthema, rash, urticaria.\rUrinary tract and kidneys: increase in BUN or creatinine, edema.\rLiver and biliary tract: increased liver enzyme activity.\rCardiovascular system: palpitations.\rIsolated cases (frequency less than 0.01%)-\rGastrointestinal tract: Gl-perforation.\rCentral nervous system: visual disturbances.\rSkin: Stevens-Johnson and Lyell's syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, vasculitis.\rBlood: anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.\rHypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, asthma, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\rCardiovascular system: elevated blood pressure, mainly in patients treated with cardiovascular drugs.\rLiver/Biliary tract: hepatitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rNSAIDs have an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis and, when given during late pregnancy, may cause the closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, prolong labor and delay parturition. Treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Based on findings from single-dose administration, a very small amount (approximately 0.2%) of tenoxicam passes into breast milk. There is no evidence of adverse reactions in breast-fed infants of mothers taking Tenoxicam. Nevertheless, infants should be weaned or the drug discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and consequently may have an undesirable effect on renal hemodynamics and on salt and water balance. It is necessary to adequately monitor the patient with a special emphasis on cardiac and renal function (BUN, creatinine, development of edema, weight gain, etc.) when giving Xten to patients with conditions that could increase their risk of developing renal failure, such as pre-existing renal disease, impaired renal function in diabetics, hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, volume depletion or concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, diuretics and corticosteroids. Xten inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Xten has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Xten is administered. Any patient being treated with Xten who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Xten should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Xten. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Xten, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced. In common with anti-inflammatory drugs, Xten may mask the usual signs of infection. Xten Tablets should not be given to patients who either dislike or do not tolerate milk products.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Children & adolescent: Xten is not recommended for use in patients under 16 years of age, as the dose and indications in this population have not been established.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Patients experiencing adverse events that might affect driving or using machines, such as vertigo, dizziness or visual disturbances should refrain from driving a car or using machines.\rOverdose Effects\rAlthough there is no experience of acute overdosage with Xten, it may be expected that the signs and symptoms mentioned under Undesirable effects would be more pronounced. Overdose should be countered by conventional measures to reduce absorption (e.g. gastrolavage and charcoal) and speed up elimination (e.g. cholestyramine).\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Nevertheless, infants should be weaned or the drug discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nNSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and consequently may have an undesirable effect on renal hemodynamics and on salt and water balance. It is necessary to adequately monitor the patient with a special emphasis on cardiac and renal function (BUN, creatinine, development of edema, weight gain, etc.) when giving Xten to patients with conditions that could increase their risk of developing renal failure, such as pre-existing renal disease, impaired renal function in diabetics, hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, volume depletion or concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, diuretics and corticosteroids. Xten inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Xten has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Xten is administered. Any patient being treated with Xten who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Xten should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Xten. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Xten, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced. In common with anti-inflammatory drugs, Xten may mask the usual signs of infection. Xten Tablets should not be given to patients who either dislike or do not tolerate milk products.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Children & adolescent: Xten is not recommended for use in patients under 16 years of age, as the dose and indications in this population have not been established.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: Patients experiencing adverse events that might affect driving or using machines, such as vertigo, dizziness or visual disturbances should refrain from driving a car or using machines.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAlthough there is no experience of acute overdosage with Xten, it may be expected that the signs and symptoms mentioned under Undesirable effects would be more pronounced. Overdose should be countered by conventional measures to reduce absorption (e.g. gastrolavage and charcoal) and speed up elimination (e.g. cholestyramine).\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rTory is indicated for the symptomatic relief of-\rOsteoarthritis (OA)\rRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\rAnkylosing spondylitis, and\rThe pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.\rFor the short-term treatment of moderate pain associated with dental surgery.\rTory - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rEtoricoxib is a potent, orally active cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor within, and significantly above, the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and adolescent over 16 years:\rOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\rPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\rSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWith medicine:\rOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Tory was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\rDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\rAcetylsalicylic Acid: Tory can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\rCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Tory, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\rLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\rWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\rActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\rPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\rPregnancy and lactation.\rSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\rEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\rChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\rInflammatory bowel disease.\rCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\rPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\rEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. It is not known whether Etoricoxib is excreted in human milk. Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\rPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with Tory after careful consideration.\rAdministration of Tory may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered.\rCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertension and in patients with pre-existing edema from any other reason.\rAny patients with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormalliver function test has occurred, should be monitored.

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult and adolescent over 16 years:\r\nOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\r\nRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\r\nAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\r\nAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\r\nPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\r\nSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nWith medicine:\r\nOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Tory was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\r\nDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\r\nAcetylsalicylic Acid: Tory can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\r\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Tory, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\r\nLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\r\nWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\r\nActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\r\nPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\r\nPregnancy and lactation.\r\nSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\r\nEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\r\nChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\r\nInflammatory bowel disease.\r\nCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\r\nPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\r\nEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. It is not known whether Etoricoxib is excreted in human milk. Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\r\nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with Tory after careful consideration.\r\nAdministration of Tory may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function.

Torax ophthalmic solution helps relieve pain, inflammation, and light sensitivity after ocular surgery. It may also be used to decrease eye inflammation or redness caused by seasonal allergies.\rDeltora - MedEx campaign banner\rDescription\rTorax is a drug of pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Torax inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Torax is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Torax is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle.

Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\rFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\rFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\rFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\rNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r  Naproxen Suspension: Children:\r For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Sonap-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Sonap and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Sonap.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rIn Chronic Spasticity: Relatro is indicated in controlling the manifestations of clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor neuronal disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis). It is of particular benefit to the patients whose functional rehabilitation has been retarded by the sequelae of spasticity. Such patients must have presumably reversible spasticity where relief of spasticity will aid in restoring residual function. Relatro is not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders. Occasionally, subtle but meaningful improvement in spasticity may occur with Relatro therapy. In such instances, information regarding improvement should be solicited from the patient. Brief withdrawal of Relatro for a period of 2 to 4 days will frequently demonstrate exacerbation of the manifestations of spasticity and may serve to confirm a clinical impression.\r A decision to continue the administration of Relatro on a long-term basis is justified if introduction of the drug into the patient's regimen:\rproduces a significant reduction in painful and/or disabling spasticity such as clonus, or\rpermits a significant reduction in the intensity and/or degree of nursing care required, or\rrids the patient of any annoying manifestation of spasticity considered important by the patient himself.\rIn Malignant Hyperthermia: Oral Relatro is also indicated preoperatively to prevent or attenuate the development of signs of malignant hyperthermia in known, or strongly suspect, malignant hyperthermia susceptible patients who require anesthesia and/or surgery. Oral Relatro should be administered following a malignant hyperthermic crisis to prevent recurrence of the signs of malignant hyperthermia.\rPharmacology\rDantrolene produces relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the skeletal muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction, directly on the muscle itself. In skeletal muscle, Dantrolene dissociates the excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\rDosage & Administration\rFor Use in Chronic Spasticity:\rAdults: The following gradual titration schedule is suggested. Some patients will not respond until higher daily dosage is achieved. Each dosage level should be maintained for seven days to determine the patient's response. If no further benefit is observed at the next higher dose, dosage should be decreased to the previous lower dose.\rStarting dose is 25 mg twice per day and it can be increased to 25-50 mg per day per week. Maximum accepted dosage is 400 mg per day.\rPaediatric Patients: The following gradual titration schedule is suggested. Some patients will not respond until higher daily dosage is achieved. Each dosage level should be maintained for seven days to determine the patient's response. If no further benefit is observed at the next higher dose, dosage should be decreased to the previous lower dose.\r0.5 mg/kg once daily for seven days, then 0.5 mg/kg 3 times for 7 days, 1 mg/kg 3 times for 7 days, 2 mg/kg 3 times a day, Therapy with a dose 4 times daily may be necessary for some individuals.\rFor Malignant Hyperthermia\rPreoperatively: Administer 4 to 8 mg/kg/day of oral Dantrolene in 3 or 4 divided doses for one or two days prior to surgery, with the last dose being given approximately 3 to 4 hours before scheduled surgery with a minimum of water.\rPost Crisis Follow-up: Oral Dantrolene should also be administered following a malignant hyperthermia crisis, in doses of 4 to 8 mg/kg per day in four divided doses, for a one to three day period to prevent recurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrowsiness may occur with Relatro therapy, and the concomitant administration of CNS depressants such as sedatives and tranquilizing agents may result in further drowsiness. Hepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of age receiving concomitant estrogen therapy.\rContraindications\rActive hepatic disease, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Relatro have been drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, and can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and increasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. Diarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of Relatro therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of Relatro, therapy should probably be withdrawn permanently\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. Dantrolene capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Dantrolene should not be used in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn view of the potential for liver damage in long-term Relatro use, therapy should be stopped if benefits are not evident within 45 days. Patients should be cautioned against driving a motor vehicle or participating in hazardous occupations while taking Relatro. Caution should be exercised in the concomitant administration of tranquilizing agents. Relatro might possibly evoke a photosensitivity reaction; patients should be cautioned about exposure to sunlight while taking it. It is important to recognize that fatal and non-fatal liver disorders of an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity type may occur with Relatro therapy. At the start of Relatro therapy, it is desirable to do liver function studies (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) for a baseline or to establish whether there is preexisting liver disease. Liver function studies (e.g., SGOT or SGPT) should be performed at appropriate intervals during Relatro therapy. Some patients have revealed a return to normal laboratory values in the face of continued therapy while others have not. If symptoms compatible with hepatitis, accompanied by abnormalities in liver function tests or jaundice appear, Relatro should be discontinued. If caused by Relatro and detected early, the abnormalities in liver function characteristically have reverted to normal when the drug was discontinued. Relatro therapy has been reinstituted in a few patients who have developed clinical and/ or laboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury. If such reinstitution of therapy is done, it should be attempted only in patients who clearly need Relatro and only after previous symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The patient should be hospitalized and the drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses. Laboratory monitoring should be frequent and the drug should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Relatro should be used with particular caution in females and in patients over 35 years of age in view of apparent greater likelihood of drug-induced, potentially fatal, hepatocellular disease in these groups.\r Relatro should be used with caution in patients with impaired pulmonary function, and in patients with severely impaired cardiac function due to myocardial disease. It should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction.\rUse in Special Populations\rUsage in Paediatric Patients: The long-term safety of Relatro in paediatric patients under the age of 5 years has not been established. Because of the possibility that adverse effects of the drug could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of Relatro is particularly important in pediatric patients.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place, protected from light.\rPack Image of Relatro 25 mg Capsule\rPack Image: Relatro 25 mg Capsule\r\u00a9 Medex \u2122 About Us Priva\nIndications\r\nIn Chronic Spasticity: Relatro is indicated in controlling the manifestations of clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor neuronal disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis).

Hepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of age receiving concomitant estrogen therapy.\r\nContraindications\r\nActive hepatic disease, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Relatro have been drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, and can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and increasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. Diarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of Relatro therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of Relatro, therapy should probably be withdrawn permanently\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. Dantrolene capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Dantrolene should not be used in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIn view of the potential for liver damage in long-term Relatro use, therapy should be stopped if benefits are not evident within 45 days. Patients should be cautioned against driving a motor vehicle or participating in hazardous occupations while taking Relatro. Caution should be exercised in the concomitant administration of tranquilizing agents. Relatro might possibly evoke a photosensitivity reaction; patients should be cautioned about exposure to sunlight while taking it. It is important to recognize that fatal and non-fatal liver disorders of an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity type may occur with Relatro therapy. At the start of Relatro therapy, it is desirable to do liver function studies (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) for a baseline or to establish whether there is preexisting liver disease. Liver function studies (e.g., SGOT or SGPT) should be performed at appropriate intervals during Relatro therapy. Some patients have revealed a return to normal laboratory values in the face of continued therapy while others have not. If symptoms compatible with hepatitis, accompanied by abnormalities in liver function tests or jaundice appear, Relatro should be discontinued. If caused by Relatro and detected early, the abnormalities in liver function characteristically have reverted to normal when the drug was discontinued. Relatro therapy has been reinstituted in a few patients who have developed clinical and/ or laboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury. If such reinstitution of therapy is done, it should be attempted only in patients who clearly need Relatro and only after previous symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The patient should be hospitalized and the drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses. Laboratory monitoring should be frequent and the drug should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Relatro should be used with particular caution in females and in patients over 35 years of age in view of apparent greater likelihood of drug-induced, potentially fatal, hepatocellular disease in these groups.\r\n \nRelatro should be used with caution in patients with impaired pulmonary function, and in patients with severely impaired cardiac function due to myocardial disease. It should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUsage in Paediatric Patients: The long-term safety of Relatro in paediatric patients under the age of 5 years has not been established. Because of the possibility that adverse effects of the drug could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of Relatro is particularly important in pediatric patients.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place, protected from light.\r\nPack Image of Relatro 25 mg Capsule\r\nPack Image: Relatro 25 mg Capsule\r\n\u00a9 Medex \u2122 About Us Priva",

        "description": "Indications\rRheumatology: Inflammatory and degenerative forms of rheumatism, chronic involutive, polyarthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylarthroses, acute gout, peri-articular rheumatic disorders.\r Surgery and Traumatology: Sprain, bruises, dislocations, fractures, softtissue injuries, surgical interventions.\r Obstetrics and Gynecology: Primary dysmenorrhoea, episiotomy, adnexitis, endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, and mastitis.\r Otorhinolaryngology: As pre-operative medication for the prevention of pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r Dentistry: Post-operative and post-traumatic pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r Other indications: For the prevention of pain and treatment of inflammation and swelling of patients operated in the urogenital tract, renal and biliary colic.\rPharmacology\rDilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\rDosage & Administration\rDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r Diclofenac SR Tablet:\rAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\rChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\rElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\rDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\rAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\rChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.\rDiclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.\r Diclofenac Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.\r Diclofenac injection: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.\r Diclofenac Gel: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rClofenac may have the following drug interactions:\r Lithium and digoxin: Clofenac may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.\r Anticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.\r Antidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.\r Cyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.\r Methotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.\r Quinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs.\rTherefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.\r Other NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.\rContraindications\rContraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products.

The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy.

It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\rDosage & Administration\rDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r Diclofenac SR Tablet:\rAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\rChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\rElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\rDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\rAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\rChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight.

        "description": "Indications\rBarif tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Barif tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Barif on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Barif may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Barif with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Barif metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Barif. Barif can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Barif or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Barif. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Barif.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Barif can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Barif. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Barif .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Barif  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Barif  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Barif have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Barif. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Barif need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Barif than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Barif -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

These include:\rPostoperative pain\rColic and spastic pain\rCancer pain\rJoint pain\rNeck and back pain\rPain associated with osteoporosis.\rPharmacology\rTramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic compound. It inhibits the re uptake of neurotransmitters- serotonin and noradrenaline. Thus it modifies the transmission of pain impulses by activating both descending serotonergic pathways and noradrenergic pathways involved in analgesia. The analgesic effects of Tramadol are mediated via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors and indirect modulation of central monoaminergic inhibitory pathways.\rDosage & Administration\rCapsule or Tablet: Usual doses are 50 to 100 mg every four to six hours. For acute pain an initial dose of 100 mg is required. For chronic painful conditions an initial dose of 50 mg is recommended. Subsequent doses should be 50 to 100 mg administered 4-6 hourly. The dose level and frequency of dosing will depend on the severity of the pain.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Sustained Release Capsule or Tablet: One SR capsule or tablet every 12 hours, for example first one in the morning and then at the same time in the evening. The number of capsules taken at a time will depend upon severity of pain, but it should not be taken more frequently than every 12 hours.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Injection: A dose of 50-100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hours by intramuscular or by intravenous infusion. For the treatment of postoperative pain,the initial dose is 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 10 to 20 minutes if necessary to a maximum of 250 mg in the first hour. Thereafter, doses are 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours up to a total daily dose of 600 mg.\r Suppository: Tramadol suppository should be administered rectally. For adults usual dose is 100 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride 6 hourly. In general, 400 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride (4 Tramadol suppository) per day sufficient. However, for the treatment of Cancer pain and severe pain after operations much higher daily doses can be used.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIn general, physician need not be concerned about drugs interacting with Anadol. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent the only drug class not recommended for combination with Anadol. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with Anadol causes a significant increase in Anadol metabolism and it requires to increase the dose of Anadol.\rContraindications\rTramadol is contraindicated in persons having hypersensitivity to this drug. It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.\rSide Effects\rCommonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRespiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.\r Opioid dependence: Anadol is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.\r Concomitant CNS depressants: Anadol should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.\r Concomitant MAO inhibitors: Anadol should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\r Anadol should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn children from the age of 1 year Anadol can be given in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight. However,suppository (100 mg Anadol) should not be administered in children and adolescents below the age of 14 years. Anadol 100 mg SR Capsules have not been studied in children.

        "description": "Indications\rRolac is indicated for the short-term management of moderate to severe acute post-operative pain. Rolac ophthalmic solution helps relieve pain, inflammation, and light sensitivity after ocular surgery. It may also be used to decrease eye inflammation or redness caused by seasonal allergies.\rDescription\rRolac is a drug of pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Rolac inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Rolac is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Rolac is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM.

        "description": "Indications\rFeburen tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Feburen tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Feburen on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Feburen may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Feburen with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Feburen metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Feburen. Feburen can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Feburen or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Feburen. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Feburen.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Feburen can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Feburen. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Feburen .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Feburen  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Feburen  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Feburen have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Feburen. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feburen need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Feburen than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Feburen -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nFeburen tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.

Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Feburen.\r\n \nColchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Feburen can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Feburen. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Feburen .\r\n \nAntacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Feburen  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Feburen  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\r\nContraindications\r\nFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Feburen have observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Feburen. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feburen need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r\n \nCardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Feburen than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r\n \nLiver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Feburen -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs used in Gout\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rFeburen tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Feburen tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Feburen on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Feburen may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Feburen with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Feburen metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Feburen. Feburen can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Feburen or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Feburen.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\rAce - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\rChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Renova XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Renova XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Renova XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Renova XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Renova XR-containing products concurrently. Renova XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Renova XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Renova XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Renova XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Renova XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Renova XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Renova XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Renova XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Renova XR-containing products concurrently. Renova XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Renova XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Renova XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Renova XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with Diclofen SR. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation. Diclofen SR Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light. Store below 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nRheumatology: Inflammatory and degenerative forms of rheumatism, chronic involutive, polyarthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylarthroses, acute gout, peri-articular rheumatic disorders.\r\n \nSurgery and Traumatology: Sprain, bruises, dislocations, fractures, softtissue injuries, surgical interventions.\r\n \nObstetrics and Gynecology: Primary dysmenorrhoea, episiotomy, adnexitis, endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, and mastitis.\r\n \nOtorhinolaryngology: As pre-operative medication for the prevention of pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r\n \nDentistry: Post-operative and post-traumatic pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r\n \nOther indications: For the prevention of pain and treatment of inflammation and swelling of patients operated in the urogenital tract, renal and biliary colic.\r\nPharmacology\r\nDilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r\n \nDiclofenac SR Tablet:\r\nAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\r\nChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\r\nElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\r\nDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\r\nAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\r\nChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.\r\nDiclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.\r\n \nDiclofenac Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.\r\n \nDiclofenac injection: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.\r\n \nDiclofenac Gel: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDiclofen SR may have the following drug interactions:\r\n \nLithium and digoxin: Diclofen SR may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.\r\n \nAnticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.\r\n \nAntidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.\r\n \nCyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.\r\n \nMethotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.\r\n \nQuinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs.\r\nTherefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.\r\n \nOther NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products. Peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity to Diclofenac like other non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents, Diclofenac is also contra-indicated in asthmatic patient in whom attack with asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by acetylsalicylic acid or by other drugs with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. This Gel should not be used under occlusive airtight dressings.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDiclofen SR is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects are mild, rare and transient. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. Diclofen SR Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDuring pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons.

Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Beklo therapy or with overdose.\r\nBeklo should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\r\nCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\r\nDuring treatment with Beklo, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Beklo should be used with caution in these circumstances.\r\nBeklo has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\r\nAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nGastric lavage is important in case of severe overdose.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of painful muscle spasms:\rAssociated with static and functional disorders of the spine (cervical and lumbar syndromes).\rFollowing surgery, e.g. for herniated intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of the hip.\rTreatment of spasticity due to neurological disorders:\rMultiple sclerosis, chronic myelopathy, degenerative spinal cord diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, and cerebral palsy.\rPharmacology\rTizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant. Its principal site of action is the spinal cord, where the evidence suggests that, by stimulating presynaptic alpha2 receptors, it inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids that stimulate N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptors.\r Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect.\r Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rTizanidine has a narrow therapeutic index and high inter-patient variability in tizanidine plasma concentrations which requires individualized dose adjustment. A low starting dose of 2 mg three times daily can minimize the risk for adverse effects. The dose should be carefully adjusted upward according to the needs of the individual patient.\r Relief of painful muscle spasms: The usual dose is 2 to 4 mg three times daily in tablet form. In severe cases, an extra dose of 2 or 4 mg may be taken, preferably at night to minimize sedation.\r Spasticity due to neurological disorders: The initial daily dose should not exceed 6 mg given in 3 divided doses. It may be increased stepwise at half-weekly or weekly intervals by 2 to 4 mg. The optimum therapeutic response is generally achieved with a daily dose of between 12 and 24 mg, administered in 3 or 4 equally spaced doses. The daily dose of 36 mg should not be exceeded.\r Pediatrics patients: Experience in patients below 18 years of age is limited and the use of Tizanidine in this population is not recommended.\r Geriatric patients (65 years of age or older): Experience with the use of Tizanidine in the elderly is limited. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at the lowest dose and increases should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy.\r Renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily. An increase in dosage should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy. If efficacy has to be improved, it is advisable to first increase the strength of the daily dose before increasing the frequency of administration.\r Hepatic impairment: Use of Tizanidine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated. While Tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, limited data are available in this population. Its use has been associated with a reversible abnormality in liver function tests. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and treatment should be started with the lowest dose. Afterward, an increase in dosage should be done carefully and according to patient tolerability.\r Discontinuation of treatment: If Tizanidine has to be discontinued, the dosage should be slowly down titrated, particularly in patients who have received high doses for a longer period of time to avoid or minimize the risk of rebound hypertension and tachycardia.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 may increase the plasma levels of tizanidine. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation. Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce the activity of CYP1A2 may decrease the plasma levels of tizanidine. The decreased plasma levels of tizanidine may reduce the therapeutic effect of Sirdalud.\r Observed interactions resulting in a contraindication: Concomitant use of Sirdalud with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Concomitant use of Sirdalud with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin resulted in a 33-fold and 10-fold increase in tizanldine AUC, respectively. Clinically significant and prolonged hypotension may result along with somnolence, dizziness and decreased psychomotor performance. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation.\r Observed interactions resulting in concomitant use not recommended: Co administration of Sirdalud with other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin), rofecoxib, oral contraceptives, and ticlopidine is not recommended.\r Observed interactions to be considered: Caution should be exercised when Sirdalud is given with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cisapride, amytriptyline and azithromycin).\r Antihypertensives: Concomitant use of Sirdalud with antihypertensives, including diuretics, may occasionally cause hypotension and bradycardia. In some patients rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed upon abrupt discontinuation of Sirdalud when concomitantly used with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident.\r Rifampicin: Concomitant administration of Sirdalud with rifampicin results in 50% decrease in tizanidine concentrations. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of Sirdalud may be reduced during treatment with rifampicin, which may be of clinical significance in some patients. Long term coadministration should be avoided and if co- administration is considered a careful dose adjustment (increase) may be required. \r Cigarette smoke: Administration of Sirdalud in smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) results in about 30% decrease in tizanidine systemic exposure. Long-term therapy with Sirdalud in heavy smokers may require higher doses than the average doses.\r Alcohol: While on Sirdalud therapy, alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided as it may increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. sedation and hypotension). The central nervous system depressant effects of alcohol may be enhanced by Sirdalud.\r Anticipated interactions to be considered: Sedatives, hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine or baclofen), and another drug such as antihistamines may enhance the sedative action of tizanidine. Sirdalud should be avoided when using with other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (such as clonidine) because of their potential additive hypotensive effect.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to tizanidine or to any of the excipients.\rSeverely impaired hepatic function.\rConcomitant use of tizanidine with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rWith low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.\r With the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.\rPsychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.\rNervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness\rCardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia\rVascular disorders: Common- Hypotension\rGastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.\rMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness\rGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue\rInvestigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs there is limited experience with the use of Tizanidine in pregnant women, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\r Animal data: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day increased gestation duration. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and development retardation occurred. At these doses, dams showed marked signs of muscle relaxation and sedation. Based on body surface area, these doses were 2.2 and 6.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg/day.\r Lactation: Small amounts of tizanidine are excreted in rat milk. Since no human (fata are available Tizanidine should not be given to women who are breast-feeding.\r Females and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing:  Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tizanidine.\r Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies have been performed showing Tizanidine to be harmful to the developing fetus. Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates) when using Tizanidine during treatment and for 1 day after stopping treatment with Tizanidine.\r Fertility: Animal data: No impairment of fertility was observed in male rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and in female rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Fertility was reduced in male rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day and in female rats receiving 10 mg/kg/day. Based on body surface area, these doses were 6.7 and 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg. At these doses, maternal behavioral effects and clinical signs were observed including marked sedation, weight loss and ataxia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCYP inhibitors: The concomitant use of Sirdalud with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is not recommended. Caution should be exercised when Sirdalud is given with drugs known to increase the QT interval.\r Hypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Sirdalud and also as a result of drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors and/or antihypertensive drugs. Severe manifestations of hypotension such as loss of consciousness and circulatory collapse have also been observed.\r Withdrawal syndrome: Rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed after sudden withdrawal of Sirdalud, when it had been used chronically, and/or in high daily dosages, and/or concomitantly with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident. Sirdalud should not be stopped abruptly, but rather gradually down titrated.\r Hepatic dysfunction: Since hepatic dysfunction has been reported in association with tizanidine, but rarely at daily doses up to 12 mg, it is recommended that liver function tests should be monitored monthly for the first four months in patients receiving doses of 12 mg and higher and in patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, anorexia or tiredness. Treatment with Sirdalud should be discontinued if serum levels of SGPT or SGOT are persistently above three times the upper limit of the normal range.\r Patients with renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) systemic exposure to tizanidine may increase up to 6 times compared to patient with normal renal function. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily.\r Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dermatitis, rash, urticarial, pruritis and erythema have been reported in association with tizanidine. Careful observation of the patient is recommended for one to two days after the first dose is administered. If anaphylaxis or angioedema with anaphylactic shock or difficulty of breathing is observed treatment with Sirdalud should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be instituted.\r Driving and using machines: Patients experiencing somnolence, dizziness or any signs or symptoms of hypotension should refrain from activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g. driving a vehicle or operating machines.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): Maximal mean plasma levels were found to be twice as high as in normal volunteers, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to approximately 14 hours, resulting in much higher (approximately 6-fold on average) AUC values.\r Hepatic impairment: No specific studies were conducted in this population. As tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP1A2 enzyme, hepatic impairment may increase its systemic exposure. Sirdalud is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Geriatrics (65 years of age and older): Pharmacokinetic data in this population are limited.\r Gender: Gender has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.\r Ethnicity: The impact of ethnic sensitivity and race on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been studied.\rOverdose Effects\rIn the few reports of Sirdalud overdosage received, recovery was uneventful, including by a patient who ingested 400 mg Sirdalud. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, QT(c) prolongation, dizziness, somnolence, miosis, restlessness, respiratory distress, coma. It is recommended to eliminate the ingested drug by repeated administration of high doses of activated charcoal. Forced diuresis is expected to accelerate the elimination of Sirdalud. Further treatment should be symptomatic.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a dry place below 30\u00b0C. Sirdalud must be kept out of the reach and sight of children.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of painful muscle spasms:\r\nAssociated with static and functional disorders of the spine (cervical and lumbar syndromes).\r\nFollowing surgery, e.g. for herniated intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of the hip.\r\nTreatment of spasticity due to neurological disorders:\r\nMultiple sclerosis, chronic myelopathy, degenerative spinal cord diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, and cerebral palsy.\r\nPharmacology\r\nTizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.

The daily dose of 36 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n \nPediatrics patients: Experience in patients below 18 years of age is limited and the use of Tizanidine in this population is not recommended.\r\n \nGeriatric patients (65 years of age or older): Experience with the use of Tizanidine in the elderly is limited. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at the lowest dose and increases should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy.\r\n \nRenal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily. An increase in dosage should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy. If efficacy has to be improved, it is advisable to first increase the strength of the daily dose before increasing the frequency of administration.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Use of Tizanidine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated. While Tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, limited data are available in this population. Its use has been associated with a reversible abnormality in liver function tests. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and treatment should be started with the lowest dose. Afterward, an increase in dosage should be done carefully and according to patient tolerability.\r\n \nDiscontinuation of treatment: If Tizanidine has to be discontinued, the dosage should be slowly down titrated, particularly in patients who have received high doses for a longer period of time to avoid or minimize the risk of rebound hypertension and tachycardia.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 may increase the plasma levels of tizanidine. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation. Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce the activity of CYP1A2 may decrease the plasma levels of tizanidine. The decreased plasma levels of tizanidine may reduce the therapeutic effect of Sirdalud.\r\n \nObserved interactions resulting in a contraindication: Concomitant use of Sirdalud with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Concomitant use of Sirdalud with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin resulted in a 33-fold and 10-fold increase in tizanldine AUC, respectively. Clinically significant and prolonged hypotension may result along with somnolence, dizziness and decreased psychomotor performance. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation.\r\n \nObserved interactions resulting in concomitant use not recommended: Co administration of Sirdalud with other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin), rofecoxib, oral contraceptives, and ticlopidine is not recommended.\r\n \nObserved interactions to be considered: Caution should be exercised when Sirdalud is given with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cisapride, amytriptyline and azithromycin).\r\n \nAntihypertensives: Concomitant use of Sirdalud with antihypertensives, including diuretics, may occasionally cause hypotension and bradycardia. In some patients rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed upon abrupt discontinuation of Sirdalud when concomitantly used with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident.\r\n \nRifampicin: Concomitant administration of Sirdalud with rifampicin results in 50% decrease in tizanidine concentrations. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of Sirdalud may be reduced during treatment with rifampicin, which may be of clinical significance in some patients. Long term coadministration should be avoided and if co- administration is considered a careful dose adjustment (increase) may be required. \r\n \nCigarette smoke: Administration of Sirdalud in smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) results in about 30% decrease in tizanidine systemic exposure. Long-term therapy with Sirdalud in heavy smokers may require higher doses than the average doses.\r\n \nAlcohol: While on Sirdalud therapy, alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided as it may increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. sedation and hypotension). The central nervous system depressant effects of alcohol may be enhanced by Sirdalud.\r\n \nAnticipated interactions to be considered: Sedatives, hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine or baclofen), and another drug such as antihistamines may enhance the sedative action of tizanidine. Sirdalud should be avoided when using with other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (such as clonidine) because of their potential additive hypotensive effect.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to tizanidine or to any of the excipients.\r\nSeverely impaired hepatic function.\r\nConcomitant use of tizanidine with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated.\r\nSide Effects\r\nWith low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.\r\n \nWith the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.\r\nPsychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.\r\nNervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness\r\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia\r\nVascular disorders: Common- Hypotension\r\nGastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.\r\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue\r\nInvestigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAs there is limited experience with the use of Tizanidine in pregnant women, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\r\n \nAnimal data: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day increased gestation duration. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and development retardation occurred. At these doses, dams showed marked signs of muscle relaxation and sedation. Based on body surface area, these doses were 2.2 and 6.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg/day.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of tizanidine are excreted in rat milk. Since no human (fata are available Tizanidine should not be given to women who are breast-feeding.\r\n \nFemales and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing:  Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tizanidine.\r\n \nContraception: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies have been performed showing Tizanidine to be harmful to the developing fetus. Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates) when using Tizanidine during treatment and for 1 day after stopping treatment with Tizanidine.\r\n \nFertility: Animal data: No impairment of fertility was observed in male rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and in female rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Fertility was reduced in male rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day and in female rats receiving 10 mg/kg/day. Based on body surface area, these doses were 6.7 and 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg. At these doses, maternal behavioral effects and clinical signs were observed including marked sedation, weight loss and ataxia.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCYP inhibitors: The concomitant use of Sirdalud with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is not recommended. Caution should be exercised when Sirdalud is given with drugs known to increase the QT interval.\r\n \nHypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Sirdalud and also as a result of drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors and/or antihypertensive drugs. Severe manifestations of hypotension such as loss of consciousness and circulatory collapse have also been observed.\r\n \nWithdrawal syndrome: Rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed after sudden withdrawal of Sirdalud, when it had been used chronically, and/or in high daily dosages, and/or concomitantly with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident. Sirdalud should not be stopped abruptly, but rather gradually down titrated.\r\n \nHepatic dysfunction: Since hepatic dysfunction has been reported in association with tizanidine, but rarely at daily doses up to 12 mg, it is recommended that liver function tests should be monitored monthly for the first four months in patients receiving doses of 12 mg and higher and in patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, anorexia or tiredness. Treatment with Sirdalud should be discontinued if serum levels of SGPT or SGOT are persistently above three times the upper limit of the normal range.\r\n \nPatients with renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) systemic exposure to tizanidine may increase up to 6 times compared to patient with normal renal function. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily.\r\n \nHypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dermatitis, rash, urticarial, pruritis and erythema have been reported in association with tizanidine. Careful observation of the patient is recommended for one to two days after the first dose is administered. If anaphylaxis or angioedema with anaphylactic shock or difficulty of breathing is observed treatment with Sirdalud should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be instituted.\r\n \nDriving and using machines: Patients experiencing somnolence, dizziness or any signs or symptoms of hypotension should refrain from activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g. driving a vehicle or operating machines.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): Maximal mean plasma levels were found to be twice as high as in normal volunteers, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to approximately 14 hours, resulting in much higher (approximately 6-fold on average) AUC values.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: No specific studies were conducted in this population. As tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP1A2 enzyme, hepatic impairment may increase its systemic exposure. Sirdalud is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\n \nGeriatrics (65 years of age and older): Pharmacokinetic data in this population are limited.\r\n \nGender: Gender has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.\r\n \nEthnicity: The impact of ethnic sensitivity and race on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been studied.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn the few reports of Sirdalud overdosage received, recovery was uneventful, including by a patient who ingested 400 mg Sirdalud. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, QT(c) prolongation, dizziness, somnolence, miosis, restlessness, respiratory distress, coma. It is recommended to eliminate the ingested drug by repeated administration of high doses of activated charcoal. Forced diuresis is expected to accelerate the elimination of Sirdalud. Further treatment should be symptomatic.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a dry place below 30\u00b0C. Sirdalud must be kept out of the reach and sight of children.",

As a result\rEsomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibition of the\rprostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of\rthe H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in\racid production, thus reducing gastric acidity\r  INDICATIONS\r It is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rehumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis,\rdysmenorrhoea and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID associated gastric\rulcers.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Progesic and other treatment options before deciding to use Progesic.

        "description": "Indications\rKolchin are indicated for treatment of acute gout flares. And also indicated in Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in adults and children 4 years or older.\rDescription\rKolchin is FDA-approved to help prevent gout and to treat sudden severe attacks of gout. In gout, crystals of uric acid are deposited in certain joints. White blood cells migrate to the areas of the body where uric acid has been deposited. They attempt to engulf the crystals, and as a result, lactic acid and pro-inflammatory enzymes are released. These substances give rise to the characteristic pain and swelling of gout. Kolchin inhibits the migration of the white blood cells into the inflamged area, causing a reduction in pain and inflammation.\rPharmacology\rAn acute attack of gout apparently occurs as a result of an inflammatory reaction to crystals of monosodium urate that are deposited in the joint tissue from hyperuric body fluids; the reaction is aggravated as more urate crystals accumulate. Leukocytes migrate to the sites where urate crystals have been deposited and try to engulf the crystals by phagocytosis. As a result lactic acid and proinflammatory enzymes are released which cause inflammation with severe pain, redness, and swelling of the affected joint. Lactic acid favors a local decrease in pH that enhances uric acid deposition. Colchicine inhibits the phagocytosis of uric acid by leukocytes & also diminishes the lactic acid production directly. Thus interrupts the cycle of urate crystal deposition and inflammatory response that sustains the acute attack of gout.\r Colchicine is absorbed when given orally, reaching a mean Cmax of 2.5 ng/mL (range 1.1 to 4.4 ng/mL) in 1 to 2 hours after a single dose administered under fasting conditions. The mean apparent volume of distribution is approximately 5 to 8 L/kg. Colchicine binding to serum protein is low (39 \u00b1 5%), primarily to albumin regardless of concentration. CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of Colchicine to 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine. Plasma levels of these metabolites are minimal (less than 5% of parent drug). Following multiple oral doses (0.6 mg twice daily), the mean elimination half-life is 26.6 to 31.2 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute gouty arthritis:\rFirst dose- 1 to 1.2 mg (two 0.5 mg or two 0.6 mg tablets) at a time every 2 hours until pain and inflammation aborted.\rThe total amount of colchicine needed to control pain and inflammation during an attack usually ranges from 4 to 8 mg.\rArticular pain and swelling typically reduced within 12 hours and are usually gone in 24 to 48 hours, An interval of three days between colchicine courses is advised in order to minimize the possibility of cumulative toxicity.\rFor prophylaxis during intercritical periods:\rTo reduce the frequency of their severity, colchicine may be administered continuously.\rIn patients who have less than one attack per year, the usual dose is 0.5 or 0.6 mg per day, three or four days a week.\rFor cases involving more than one attack per year, the usual dose is 0.5 or 0.6 mg daily.\rSevere cases may require two or three 0.5 mg or 0.6 mg tablets daily.\rFor prophylaxis against attacks of gout in patients undergoing surgery:\rIn patients with gout, an attack may be precipitated by even a minor surgical procedure. One 0.5 mg tablet or one 0.6 mg tablet three times daily should be administered for three days before and three days after surgery.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin or cyclosporine) have been demonstrated to alter the concentration of Kolchin\rContraindications\rPatients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given Colchicine in conjunction with Permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin or cyclosporine).\rSide Effects\rBlood dyscrasias: Myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported.

A review of 150 patients who overdosed on Kolchin found that those who ingested less than 0.5 mg/kg survived and tended to have milder toxicities, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas those who took 0.5 to 0.8 mg/kg had more severe reactions, such as myelosuppression.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C temperature.

Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Following an initial loading dose of 50 mg, 25-50 mg is to be taken every eight hours if necessary.\r Migraine: An initial loading dose of 50 mg, then if necessary a further 25-50 mg after 2 hours. The maximum daily dose is 150 mg. The tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid, preferably before meals.\r Children: Children over 14 years of age: upto 75 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIntafenac K may have the following drug interactions:\rLithium and Digoxin: Intafenac K may increase plasma concentrations of Lithium and Digoxin.\rAnticoagulant:There are isolated reports of and increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Intafenac K and anticoagulant therapy.\rCyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Intafenac K concomitantly.\rMethotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.\rDiuretics: Like other NSAIDs, Intafenac K may inhibit the activity of diuretics.\rOther NSAIDs and steroids; Co-administration of Intafenac K with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects.\rContraindications\rDiclofenac Potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Diclofenac. Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects of Intafenac K are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. Intafenac K should be discontinued. Occasional: epigastric pain, other gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dyspepsia,flatulence,anorexia). Rare: gastro-intestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer (with or without bleeding or perforation), bloody diarrhoea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDiclofenac should not be prescribed during pregnancy, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. This type of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy.

Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults: Following an initial loading dose of 50 mg, 25-50 mg is to be taken every eight hours if necessary.\r\n \nMigraine: An initial loading dose of 50 mg, then if necessary a further 25-50 mg after 2 hours. The maximum daily dose is 150 mg. The tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid, preferably before meals.\r\n \nChildren: Children over 14 years of age: upto 75 mg daily in divided doses.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nIntafenac K may have the following drug interactions:\r\nLithium and Digoxin: Intafenac K may increase plasma concentrations of Lithium and Digoxin.\r\nAnticoagulant:There are isolated reports of and increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of Intafenac K and anticoagulant therapy.\r\nCyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Cyclosporin and Intafenac K concomitantly.\r\nMethotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when Methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.\r\nDiuretics: Like other NSAIDs, Intafenac K may inhibit the activity of diuretics.\r\nOther NSAIDs and steroids; Co-administration of Intafenac K with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects.\r\nContraindications\r\nDiclofenac Potassium tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Diclofenac. Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects of Intafenac K are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. Intafenac K should be discontinued. Occasional: epigastric pain, other gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dyspepsia,flatulence,anorexia). Rare: gastro-intestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer (with or without bleeding or perforation), bloody diarrhoea.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDiclofenac should not be prescribed during pregnancy, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. The lowest effective dosage should be used. This type of drugs are not recommended during the last trimester of pregnancy. Very small quantities of diclofenac may be detected in breast milk, but no undesirable effects on the infant are to be expected.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

The following dosage titration\rschedule is suggested:\r 5 mg 3 times daily for 3 days,\r10 mg 3 times daily for 3 days,\r15 mg 3 times daily for 3 days,\r20 mg 3 times daily for 3 days,\r25 mg 3 times daily for 3 days.\r Thereafter, additional increases may be necessary. The optimum dosage generally ranges from 30 - 80 mg daily in 3 - 4 divided\rdoses. Daily doses of 100 - 120 mg may be given to carefully supervised patients in hospitals.\r Children:\rTreatment should be started at a very low dose, e.g., 0.3 mg/kg per day in divided (preferably 4) doses. The dosage should be\rraised cautiously at 1-2 week intervals until it is sufficient for the child\\'s individual needs. The usual dosage range for\rmaintenance therapy is 0.75 to 2 mg/kg body weight per day. In children aged over 10 years a maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg body\rweight may be given.\r Renal Insufficiency:\rBaclofen is excreted principally in urine as unchanged drug. So it may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with impaired\rrenal function.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r The most common side effects include drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, lassitude, lightheadedness, confusion, fatigue, muscular pain\r& weakness and hypotension.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Patients suffering from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders, confusional states or Parkinson\\'s\rdisease, should be treated cautiously with Baclofen. Baclofen stimulates gastric acid secretion and should be used with caution in\rpatients with a history of peptic ulcer and avoided in those with active peptic ulcer disease .

Baclofen may cause drowsiness; patients affected should not drive or\roperate machinery. Abrupt withdrawal of Baclofen may result in a withdrawal syndrome and exacerbation of spasticity; dosage should\rbe reduced gradually over at least 1 to 2 weeks, or longer if symptoms occur.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Baclofen in pregnant women. So it should be used during pregnancy only if the\rpotential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.\r Baclofen is excreted in breast milk.

Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Etorac inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Etorac is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Etorac is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting.

Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Etorac inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Etorac is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Etorac is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\r\nPharmacology\r\nKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r\n \nInjection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.\r\n \nSingle-Dose Treatment-\r\nIM Dosing (Adult):\r\nPatients <65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.\r\nPatients >65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.\r\nIV Dosing (Adult):\r\nPatients <65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.\r\nPatients >65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.\r\nIV or IM Dosing (2 to 16 years of age):\r\nIM Dosing: One dose of 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30 mg.\r\nIV Dosing: One dose of 0.5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 15 mg.\r\nMultiple-Dose Treatment (IV or IM)-\r\nPatients <65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg Ketorolac injection every 6 hours.

GABA receptor agonists typically produce sedative effect and may also cause other effects such as anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant. Metabolite of Carisoprodol, Meprobamate, has anxiolytic and sedative properties. Carisoprodol decreases the impulses from brain and spinal cord to the muscle. This causes the muscle to relax and hence decrease the spasm. It has no direct action on muscle itself.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults (18 years and older): The recommended dose of Carisoprodol is 250 mg to 350 mg three times a day and at bedtime.

Caution should be exercised when Carisoprodol is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nDue to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Cases of Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse. Seizures\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nOverdosage of Carilax commonly produces CNS depression. Death, coma, respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures have been reported with Carilax overdosage. Basic life support measures should be instituted in Carilax overdose. Induced emesis is not recommended due to the risk of CNS and respiratory depression. Gastric lavage should be considered soon after ingestion (within one hour). Circulatory support should be administered with volume infusion and vasopressor agents if needed. Seizures should be treated with intravenous benzodiazepines and the reoccurrence of seizures may be treated with phenobarbital. In cases of severe CNS depression, airway protective reflexes may be compromised and tracheal intubation should be considered for airway protection and respiratory support.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLocally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool and dry place at room temperature 20\u00b0-25\u00b0C, away from direct light.

        "description": "Indications\rZeropain is indicated for the short-term management of moderate to severe acute post-operative pain. Zeropain ophthalmic solution helps relieve pain, inflammation, and light sensitivity after ocular surgery. It may also be used to decrease eye inflammation or redness caused by seasonal allergies.\rDeltora - MedEx campaign banner\rDescription\rZeropain is a drug of pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Zeropain inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Zeropain is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Zeropain is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM.

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\rAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\rWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\rWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\rHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\rUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly.

Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\nWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\r\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\r\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r\n \nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r\n \nHepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r\n \nRelated to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r\n \nManagement: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r\n \nRelated to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napryn-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napryn and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napryn.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r\n \nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\r\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\r\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\r\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\r\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\n \n \nNaproxen Suspension: Children:\r\n \nFor juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension:\r\n13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\r\n38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n \nNaproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.\r\nAntacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Napryn.\r\nAspirin: increase adverse effects.\r\nDiuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.\r\nMethotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.\r\nWarfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nContraindications\r\nNaproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost frequently reported side effects include following:\r\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\r\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\r\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\r\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napryn-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napryn and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r\n \nHepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napryn.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rFeluric tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Feluric tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Feluric on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Feluric may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Feluric with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Feluric metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Feluric. Feluric can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Feluric or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Feluric. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Feluric.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Feluric can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Feluric. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Feluric .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Feluric  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Feluric  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Feluric have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Feluric. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feluric need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Feluric than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Feluric -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nFeluric tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\rAce - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\rChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Tamen XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Tamen XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Tamen XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Tamen XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Tamen XR-containing products concurrently. Tamen XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Tamen XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Tamen XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Tamen XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Tamen XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Tamen XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Tamen XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Tamen overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Tamen levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Tamen are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Tamen to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Tamen-containing products concurrently. Tamen should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Tamen. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Tamen may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Tamen overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Tamen overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Tamen concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Tamen. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\rFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Naprox-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Naprox and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Naprox.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nNaprox is indicated for the relief of sign and symptoms of-\r\nrheumatoid arthritis\r\nosteoarthritis\r\nankylosing spondylitis\r\njuvenile arthritis\r\ntendonitis\r\nbursitis\r\nacute gout\r\nIt is also indicated for the management of primary dysmenorrhea & pain.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAs with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r\n \nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\r\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals.

The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r\n \nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\r\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\r\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\r\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\r\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\n \n \nNaproxen Suspension: Children:\r\n \nFor juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension:\r\n13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\r\n38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n \nNaproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.\r\nAntacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Naprox.\r\nAspirin: increase adverse effects.\r\nDiuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.\r\nMethotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.\r\nWarfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nContraindications\r\nNaproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost frequently reported side effects include following:\r\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\r\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\r\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\r\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Naprox-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Naprox and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r\n \nHepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Naprox.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\rAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\rWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\rWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\rHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\rUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult and adolescent over 16 years:\r\nOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\r\nRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\r\nAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\r\nAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\r\nPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\r\nSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nWith medicine:\r\nOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Etorix was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\r\nDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\r\nAcetylsalicylic Acid: Etorix can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\r\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Etorix, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\r\nLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\r\nWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\r\nActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\r\nPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\r\nPregnancy and lactation.\r\nSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\r\nEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\r\nChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\r\nInflammatory bowel disease.\r\nCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\r\nPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\r\nEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.

Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\r\nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with Etorix after careful consideration.\r\nAdministration of Etorix may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered.\r\nCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertension and in patients with pre-existing edema from any other reason.\r\nAny patients with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormalliver function test has occurred, should be monitored. If signs of hepatic insufficiency occur, or if persistently abnormal liver function tests (three times the upper limit of normal) are detected, Etorix should be discontinued.\r\nEtorix should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\r\nEtorix may mask fever and other signs of inflammation. Caution should be exercised when co-administering Etorix with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAdministration of single doses of Etorix up to 500 mg and multiple doses up to 150 mg/day for 21 days did not result in significant toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the Gl tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is probably the basis of the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Following absorption, Sulindac undergoes two major transformations. It is oxidised to the sulphone and then reversibly reduced to the sulphide. The sulphide metabolite is the biologically active form which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.\rDosage & Administration\rSulindac should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended. In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis & ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg. In acute painful shoulder & acute gouty arthritis the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response.

Patient should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no chance in their anticoagulant or hypoglycemic dosage is required. Aspirin has been shown to decrease the bioavailability of the active sulfide metabolite of Sudac. Prolonged concurrent use of Paracetamol with Sudac may increase the risk of adverse renal effects. That patient is under close medical supervision while receiving such combined therapy. Probenecid may increase the plasma concentration of Sudac and its sulfone metabolite and slightly decrease the plasma concentration of the active sulfide metabolite.\rContraindications\rPatients known to be allergic to Sulindac and those in whom acute asthmatic attacks, urticaria or rhinitis have been precipitated by Aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Sulindac is also contraindicated in patients with a history of active gastro-intestinal bleeding or peptic ulceration. It should not be given to children, pregnant or lactating women.\rSide Effects\rGastrointestinal side effects are the most common and consist of abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding may also occur. The most frequently reported central nervous system side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, headache and nervousness. Other adverse effects include depression, tinnitus, confusion, light-headedness, insomnia, psychiatric disturbances, syncope, convulsions, coma, peripheral neuropathy, blurred vision and other ocular effects, oedema and mass gain, hypertension, hematuria, skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, stomatitis, alopecia and hypersensitivity reactions. A hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever and chills, skin rashes or other cutaneous manifestations, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity (including renal failure), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, inflammed glands or lymph nodes, and arthralgia have been reported. Leucopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia, agranulocytosis, epitaxis, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia and vaginal bleeding have been reported. There have also been reports of hepatitis and jaundice or renal failure.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in pregnancy: Sulindac should be used during the first two trimesters of pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Use of Sulindac during the third trimester of pregnancy is not recommended.\r Use in lactation: It is not known whether Sulindac is excreted in human milk. So a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the medicine taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSudac should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function and bleeding disorders, epilepsy, parkinsonism or psychiatric disorders. Patient with hepatic impairment the half life of Sudac is prolonged and a reduction of daily dosage may be required. Anemia is some time seen in patients receiving NSAIDs with Sudac.\rUse in Special Populations\rPatient with renal impairment: Sudac should be administered with caution to patients with impaired renal function and to those with bleeding disorders, epilepsy, parkinsonism or psychiatric disorders.\r Patient with hepatic impairment: In the presence of liver function impairment the half life of Sudac is prolonged and a reduction of daily dosage may be required.\rOverdose Effects\rReported symptoms have generally reflected the gastro-intestinal, renal and central nervous system toxicities of Sudac.

Prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is probably the basis of the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Following absorption, Sulindac undergoes two major transformations. It is oxidised to the sulphone and then reversibly reduced to the sulphide. The sulphide metabolite is the biologically active form which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.\rDosage & Administration\rSulindac should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended. In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis & ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg. In acute painful shoulder & acute gouty arthritis the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.

Patient should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no chance in their anticoagulant or hypoglycemic dosage is required. Aspirin has been shown to decrease the bioavailability of the active sulfide metabolite of Sudac. Prolonged concurrent use of Paracetamol with Sudac may increase the risk of adverse renal effects. That patient is under close medical supervision while receiving such combined therapy. Probenecid may increase the plasma concentration of Sudac and its sulfone metabolite and slightly decrease the plasma concentration of the active sulfide metabolite.\rContraindications\rPatients known to be allergic to Sulindac and those in whom acute asthmatic attacks, urticaria or rhinitis have been precipitated by Aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Sulindac is also contraindicated in patients with a history of active gastro-intestinal bleeding or peptic ulceration. It should not be given to children, pregnant or lactating women.\rSide Effects\rGastrointestinal side effects are the most common and consist of abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding may also occur. The most frequently reported central nervous system side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, headache and nervousness. Other adverse effects include depression, tinnitus, confusion, light-headedness, insomnia, psychiatric disturbances, syncope, convulsions, coma, peripheral neuropathy, blurred vision and other ocular effects, oedema and mass gain, hypertension, hematuria, skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, stomatitis, alopecia and hypersensitivity reactions. A hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever and chills, skin rashes or other cutaneous manifestations, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity (including renal failure), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, inflammed glands or lymph nodes, and arthralgia have been reported.

Pair ophthalmic solution helps relieve pain, inflammation, and light sensitivity after ocular surgery. It may also be used to decrease eye inflammation or redness caused by seasonal allergies.\rDescription\rPair is a drug of pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Pair inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Pair is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Pair is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM.

Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Following an initial loading dose of 50 mg, 25-50 mg is to be taken every eight hours if necessary.\r Migraine: An initial loading dose of 50 mg, then if necessary a further 25-50 mg after 2 hours.

Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects of Nopain are usually mild and transient. However, if serious side-effects occur. Nopain should be discontinued. Occasional: epigastric pain, other gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, dyspepsia,flatulence,anorexia). Rare: gastro-intestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer (with or without bleeding or perforation), bloody diarrhoea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDiclofenac should not be prescribed during pregnancy, unless there are compelling reasons for doing so.

It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance.

        "description": "Indications\rCardizem film-coated tablet is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic stable (classical) and vasopastic angina pectoris and has also been used alone or in combination in the management of hypertension, also, Cardizem is effective in myocardial infarction, coronary artery spasm, arrhythmias, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal motility disorder and migraine.\r Cardizem sustained release tablet is indicated in the prophylaxis and treatment of angina pectoris. It is used in the management of classical and vasospastic angina pectoris. It has also been used in the treatment of essential hypertension. It is used for prophylaxis of some selected supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\rPharmacology\rDiltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium channel antagonist. It is a peripheral and coronary vasodilator with some negative inotropic activity. Diltiazem inhibits cardiac conduction particularly at the sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. Diltiazem has the following actions:\r Antianginal: A direct dilatation of coronary arteries and arterioles proved oxygen supply to myocardial tissues. In addition dilatation of the peripheral vasculature reduces systemic pressure of cardiac \"after load\" which results in lessened stress and reduced oxygen requirements of the myocardial tissues.\r Antiarrhythmic: The inhibited influx of calcium ions in cardiac tissues result in slowed electrophysiological activity through the S-A and A-V nodes without affecting accessory bypass conduction or altering normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction.\r Antihypertensive: Reduces peripheral vascular resistance as a result of vasodilatation. More than 90% of an oral dose is rapidly absorbed. Protein binding is very high. Peak plasma concentration reaches within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolised in the liver and excreted (60%) through bile.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated formulation: The usual dose of Diltiazem Hydrochloride film coated tablet is 60 mg thrice daily. However patient's response may vary and dosage requirements can differ significantly between individual patients. If necessary, the divided dose may be increased to 180-300 mg/day. Dosage may be started as 30 mg four times daily and increasing at 1 to 2 days intervals until the optimum response is achieved. Higher doses upto 480 mg/day have been used with benefit in some patients especially in unstable angina. Elderly and patients with impaired hepatic or renal function: The recommended starting dose is 60 mg twice daily. The heart rate should be measured regularly and the dose should not be increased if the heart rate falls below 50 beats per minute.\r Sustained release formulation:\r Mild to moderate hypertension: initially 90 mg or 120 mg twice daily (elderly once daily); up to 360 mg daily may be required (elderly upto 240 mg) daily.\rAngina: initially 90 mg or 120 mg twice daily in divided doses may be required (elderly up to 240 mg daily).\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant prophylactic therapy with short-or long-acting nitrates may be administered safely during diltiazem therapy.

        "description": "Indications\rCardiron tablet is used for many serious arrhythmias of the heart including ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter.\r Cardiron injection is an antiarrhythmic agent indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation (VF) and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients refractory to other therapy.\rPharmacology\rAmiodarone Hydrochloride is used to correct abnormal rhythms of the heart. Amiodarone is considered a \"broad spectrum\" antiarrhythmic medication. The most important electrical effects of the drug includes : a delay in the rate at which the heart\u2019s electrical system \"recharges\" after the heart contracts (repolarisation); a prolongation in the electrical phase during which the heart\u2019s muscle cells are electrically stimulated (action potential); a slowing of the speed of electrical conduction (how fast each individual impulse is conducted through the heart\u2019s electrical system); a reduction in the rapidity of firing of the normal generator of electrical impulses in the heart (the heart\u2019s pacemaker); and a slowing of conduction through various specialised electrical pathways (called accessory pathways). In addition to being an antiarrhythmic medication, Amiodarone also causes blood vessels to dilate. Because of this effect it also may be of benefit in patients with  congestive heart failure. This effect can result in drop of blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: 200 mg 3 times daily for 1 week reduced to 200 mg twice daily or the minimum required to control arrhythmia. Amiodarone is usually given in several daily doses to minimize stomach upset which is seen more frequently with higher doses. For this same reason, it is also recommended that Amiodarone should be taken with meals.\r Injection: The recommended starting dose is about 1000 mg over the first 24 hours of therapy, delivered by the following infusion regimen:\rInitial Load: 150 mg per 100 mL (in D5W or Normal Saline) infused over 10 minutes\rFollowed by: 1 mg/min for 6 hours\rFollowed by: 0.5 mg/min thereafter\rIn the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT: Repeat the Initial Load described above as needed (infused over 10 minutes). Increase the rate of maintenance infusion to achieve effective arrhythmia suppression.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCardiron may interact with b blockers such as Atenolol, Propranolol, Metoprolol, or certain calcium channel blockers, such as Verapamil or Diltiazem, resulting in an excessively slow heart rate. Cardiron increases the blood levels of Digoxin when the two drugs are given together. Flecainide blood concentrations increase by more than 50% with Cardiron. Procainamide and Quinidine concentrations increase by 30-50% during the first week of Cardiron therapy. Cardiron also can interact with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Cardiron interacts with Warfarin and increases the risk of bleeding. Cardiron inhibits the metabolism of Dextromethorphan.\rContraindications\rAmiodarone is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock; severe sinus-node dysfunction, causing marked sinus bradycardia; second- or third degree atrioventricular block; and when episodes of bradycardia have caused syncope (except when used in conjunction with a pacemaker). Amiodarone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or to any of its components, including iodine.\rSide Effects\rThe most severe side effects of Cardiron therapy are related to the lungs. These reactions can be fatal. Patients should report any symptoms of cough, fever, or painful breathing. Although quite rare, fatal liver toxicity may occur with Cardiron therapy. Reversible corneal microdeposits (sometimes with night glare), rarely impaired vision due to optic neuritis; peripheral neuropathy and myopathy (usually reversible on withdrawal); bradycardia and conduction disturbances; phototoxicity and rarely persistent skin discolouration; hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism; raised serum transaminases; jaundice, hepatitis and cirrhosis are reported. Other rare complaints are nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, tremor, sweating, vertigo, headache, sleeplessness, fatigue, alopecia, benign raised intracranial pressure, ataxia, rashes, vasculitis, renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic or aplastic anaemia. In some cases, dose of Cardiron may be reduced. In other cases, Cardiron therapy may need to be stopped.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIn general, Amiodarone should not be administered during pregnancy because there have been reports of hypo or hyperthyroidism in infants from oral Amiodarone use during pregnancy. If Amiodarone use is considered essential, however, the patient should be warned of the risk to the foetus. The safe use of Amiodarone in lactating women has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rPotassium channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It may also act at intraspinal sites producing CNS depression. Baclofen also exerts an antinociceptive effect.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult & children over 10 years: 5 mg 3 times daily, preferably with or after food, gradually increased; max. 100 mg daily.\r Children <10 years: Treatment is usually started with 2.5 mg (2.5 ml) given 4 times daily then raised according to requirement. Daily maintenance dose-\r12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\r2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\r6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIncreased sedation may occur if Bacmax is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\rCombined treatment with Bacmax and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\rThe concomitant administration of Bacmax and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Bacmax resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\rIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Bacmax and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\rThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Bacmax may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\rCaution should be exercised when administering Bacmax and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.\rContraindications\rBaclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse reactions associated with Bacmax are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\rCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\rGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\rGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\rOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\rPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\rIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Bacmax may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued. Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Bacmax therapy or with overdose.\rBacmax should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\rCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\rDuring treatment with Bacmax, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Bacmax should be used with caution in these circumstances.\rBacmax has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\rAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.\rOverdose Effects\rGastric lavage is important in case of severe overdose.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nBacmax is indicated in-\r\nspasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis\r\nflexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus and muscular rigidity\r\nskeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders\r\nspinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases\r\ncerebrovascular accidents or neoplastic or degenerative brain disease\r\nPharmacology\r\nBaclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level by stimulating the GABAB receptors, which inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate. It may also act at intraspinal sites producing CNS depression. Baclofen also exerts an antinociceptive effect.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult & children over 10 years: 5 mg 3 times daily, preferably with or after food, gradually increased; max. 100 mg daily.\r\n \nChildren <10 years: Treatment is usually started with 2.5 mg (2.5 ml) given 4 times daily then raised according to requirement. Daily maintenance dose-\r\n12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\r\n2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\r\n6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nIncreased sedation may occur if Bacmax is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\r\nCombined treatment with Bacmax and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\r\nThe concomitant administration of Bacmax and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Bacmax resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\r\nIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Bacmax and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\r\nThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Bacmax may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\r\nCaution should be exercised when administering Bacmax and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.\r\nContraindications\r\nBaclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reactions associated with Bacmax are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\r\nCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\r\nGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\r\nGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\r\nOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\r\nPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\r\nIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Bacmax may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of painful muscle spasms:\rAssociated with static and functional disorders of the spine (cervical and lumbar syndromes).\rFollowing surgery, e.g. for herniated intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of the hip.\rTreatment of spasticity due to neurological disorders:\rMultiple sclerosis, chronic myelopathy, degenerative spinal cord diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, and cerebral palsy.\rPharmacology\rTizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant. Its principal site of action is the spinal cord, where the evidence suggests that, by stimulating presynaptic alpha2 receptors, it inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids that stimulate N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptors.\r Polysynaptic signal transmission at spinal interneuron level, which is responsible for excessive muscle tone, is thus inhibited and muscle tone reduced. In addition to its muscle-relaxant properties, tizanidine also exerts a moderate central analgesic effect.\r Pharmacodynamic: Tizanidine is effective in both acute painful muscle spasms and chronic spasticity of spinal and cerebral origin. It reduces resistance to passive movements, alleviates spasms and clonus, and may improve voluntary strength. The antispastic activity (measured by the Ashworth score and pendulum test) and adverse effects (heart rate and blood pressure) of Tizanidine are related to plasma tizanidine concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rTizanidine has a narrow therapeutic index and high inter-patient variability in tizanidine plasma concentrations which requires individualized dose adjustment. A low starting dose of 2 mg three times daily can minimize the risk for adverse effects. The dose should be carefully adjusted upward according to the needs of the individual patient.\r Relief of painful muscle spasms: The usual dose is 2 to 4 mg three times daily in tablet form. In severe cases, an extra dose of 2 or 4 mg may be taken, preferably at night to minimize sedation.\r Spasticity due to neurological disorders: The initial daily dose should not exceed 6 mg given in 3 divided doses. It may be increased stepwise at half-weekly or weekly intervals by 2 to 4 mg. The optimum therapeutic response is generally achieved with a daily dose of between 12 and 24 mg, administered in 3 or 4 equally spaced doses. The daily dose of 36 mg should not be exceeded.\r Pediatrics patients: Experience in patients below 18 years of age is limited and the use of Tizanidine in this population is not recommended.\r Geriatric patients (65 years of age or older): Experience with the use of Tizanidine in the elderly is limited. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at the lowest dose and increases should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy.\r Renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min), it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily. An increase in dosage should be done in small steps according to tolerability and efficacy. If efficacy has to be improved, it is advisable to first increase the strength of the daily dose before increasing the frequency of administration.\r Hepatic impairment: Use of Tizanidine in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated. While Tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, limited data are available in this population. Its use has been associated with a reversible abnormality in liver function tests. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and treatment should be started with the lowest dose. Afterward, an increase in dosage should be done carefully and according to patient tolerability.\r Discontinuation of treatment: If Tizanidine has to be discontinued, the dosage should be slowly down titrated, particularly in patients who have received high doses for a longer period of time to avoid or minimize the risk of rebound hypertension and tachycardia.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 may increase the plasma levels of tizanidine. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation. Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce the activity of CYP1A2 may decrease the plasma levels of tizanidine. The decreased plasma levels of tizanidine may reduce the therapeutic effect of Relentus.\r Observed interactions resulting in a contraindication: Concomitant use of Relentus with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Concomitant use of Relentus with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin resulted in a 33-fold and 10-fold increase in tizanldine AUC, respectively. Clinically significant and prolonged hypotension may result along with somnolence, dizziness and decreased psychomotor performance. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation.\r Observed interactions resulting in concomitant use not recommended: Co administration of Relentus with other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin), rofecoxib, oral contraceptives, and ticlopidine is not recommended.\r Observed interactions to be considered: Caution should be exercised when Relentus is given with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cisapride, amytriptyline and azithromycin).\r Antihypertensives: Concomitant use of Relentus with antihypertensives, including diuretics, may occasionally cause hypotension and bradycardia. In some patients rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed upon abrupt discontinuation of Relentus when concomitantly used with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident.\r Rifampicin: Concomitant administration of Relentus with rifampicin results in 50% decrease in tizanidine concentrations. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of Relentus may be reduced during treatment with rifampicin, which may be of clinical significance in some patients. Long term coadministration should be avoided and if co- administration is considered a careful dose adjustment (increase) may be required. \r Cigarette smoke: Administration of Relentus in smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) results in about 30% decrease in tizanidine systemic exposure. Long-term therapy with Relentus in heavy smokers may require higher doses than the average doses.\r Alcohol: While on Relentus therapy, alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided as it may increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. sedation and hypotension). The central nervous system depressant effects of alcohol may be enhanced by Relentus.\r Anticipated interactions to be considered: Sedatives, hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine or baclofen), and another drug such as antihistamines may enhance the sedative action of tizanidine. Relentus should be avoided when using with other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (such as clonidine) because of their potential additive hypotensive effect.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to tizanidine or to any of the excipients.\rSeverely impaired hepatic function.\rConcomitant use of tizanidine with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rWith low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.\r With the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.\rPsychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.\rNervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness\rCardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia\rVascular disorders: Common- Hypotension\rGastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.\rMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness\rGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue\rInvestigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs there is limited experience with the use of Tizanidine in pregnant women, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\r Animal data: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day increased gestation duration. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and development retardation occurred. At these doses, dams showed marked signs of muscle relaxation and sedation. Based on body surface area, these doses were 2.2 and 6.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg/day.\r Lactation: Small amounts of tizanidine are excreted in rat milk. Since no human (fata are available Tizanidine should not be given to women who are breast-feeding.\r Females and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing:  Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tizanidine.\r Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies have been performed showing Tizanidine to be harmful to the developing fetus. Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates) when using Tizanidine during treatment and for 1 day after stopping treatment with Tizanidine.\r Fertility: Animal data: No impairment of fertility was observed in male rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and in female rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Fertility was reduced in male rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day and in female rats receiving 10 mg/kg/day. Based on body surface area, these doses were 6.7 and 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg. At these doses, maternal behavioral effects and clinical signs were observed including marked sedation, weight loss and ataxia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCYP inhibitors: The concomitant use of Relentus with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is not recommended. Caution should be exercised when Relentus is given with drugs known to increase the QT interval.\r Hypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Relentus and also as a result of drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors and/or antihypertensive drugs. Severe manifestations of hypotension such as loss of consciousness and circulatory collapse have also been observed.\r Withdrawal syndrome: Rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed after sudden withdrawal of Relentus, when it had been used chronically, and/or in high daily dosages, and/or concomitantly with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident. Relentus should not be stopped abruptly, but rather gradually down titrated.\r Hepatic dysfunction: Since hepatic dysfunction has been reported in association with tizanidine, but rarely at daily doses up to 12 mg, it is recommended that liver function tests should be monitored monthly for the first four months in patients receiving doses of 12 mg and higher and in patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, anorexia or tiredness. Treatment with Relentus should be discontinued if serum levels of SGPT or SGOT are persistently above three times the upper limit of the normal range.\r Patients with renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) systemic exposure to tizanidine may increase up to 6 times compared to patient with normal renal function. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily.\r Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dermatitis, rash, urticarial, pruritis and erythema have been reported in association with tizanidine. Careful observation of the patient is recommended for one to two days after the first dose is administered. If anaphylaxis or angioedema with anaphylactic shock or difficulty of breathing is observed treatment with Relentus should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be instituted.\r Driving and using machines: Patients experiencing somnolence, dizziness or any signs or symptoms of hypotension should refrain from activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g. driving a vehicle or operating machines.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): Maximal mean plasma levels were found to be twice as high as in normal volunteers, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to approximately 14 hours, resulting in much higher (approximately 6-fold on average) AUC values.\r Hepatic impairment: No specific studies were conducted in this population. As tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP1A2 enzyme, hepatic impairment may increase its systemic exposure. Relentus is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Geriatrics (65 years of age and older): Pharmacokinetic data in this population are limited.\r Gender: Gender has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.\r Ethnicity: The impact of ethnic sensitivity and race on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been studied.\rOverdose Effects\rIn the few reports of Relentus overdosage received, recovery was uneventful, including by a patient who ingested 400 mg Relentus. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, QT(c) prolongation, dizziness, somnolence, miosis, restlessness, respiratory distress, coma. It is recommended to eliminate the ingested drug by repeated administration of high doses of activated charcoal. Forced diuresis is expected to accelerate the elimination of Relentus. Further treatment should be symptomatic.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a dry place below 30\u00b0C. Relentus must be kept out of the reach and sight of children.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of painful muscle spasms:\r\nAssociated with static and functional disorders of the spine (cervical and lumbar syndromes).\r\nFollowing surgery, e.g. for herniated intervertebral disc or osteoarthritis of the hip.\r\nTreatment of spasticity due to neurological disorders:\r\nMultiple sclerosis, chronic myelopathy, degenerative spinal cord diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, and cerebral palsy.\r\nPharmacology\r\nTizanidine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.

Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce the activity of CYP1A2 may decrease the plasma levels of tizanidine. The decreased plasma levels of tizanidine may reduce the therapeutic effect of Relentus.\r\n \nObserved interactions resulting in a contraindication: Concomitant use of Relentus with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin, both CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Concomitant use of Relentus with fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin resulted in a 33-fold and 10-fold increase in tizanldine AUC, respectively. Clinically significant and prolonged hypotension may result along with somnolence, dizziness and decreased psychomotor performance. The increased plasma levels of tizanidine may result in overdose symptoms such as QT(c) prolongation.\r\n \nObserved interactions resulting in concomitant use not recommended: Co administration of Relentus with other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin), rofecoxib, oral contraceptives, and ticlopidine is not recommended.\r\n \nObserved interactions to be considered: Caution should be exercised when Relentus is given with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cisapride, amytriptyline and azithromycin).\r\n \nAntihypertensives: Concomitant use of Relentus with antihypertensives, including diuretics, may occasionally cause hypotension and bradycardia. In some patients rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed upon abrupt discontinuation of Relentus when concomitantly used with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident.\r\n \nRifampicin: Concomitant administration of Relentus with rifampicin results in 50% decrease in tizanidine concentrations. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of Relentus may be reduced during treatment with rifampicin, which may be of clinical significance in some patients. Long term coadministration should be avoided and if co- administration is considered a careful dose adjustment (increase) may be required. \r\n \nCigarette smoke: Administration of Relentus in smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) results in about 30% decrease in tizanidine systemic exposure. Long-term therapy with Relentus in heavy smokers may require higher doses than the average doses.\r\n \nAlcohol: While on Relentus therapy, alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided as it may increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. sedation and hypotension). The central nervous system depressant effects of alcohol may be enhanced by Relentus.\r\n \nAnticipated interactions to be considered: Sedatives, hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine or baclofen), and another drug such as antihistamines may enhance the sedative action of tizanidine. Relentus should be avoided when using with other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (such as clonidine) because of their potential additive hypotensive effect.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to tizanidine or to any of the excipients.\r\nSeverely impaired hepatic function.\r\nConcomitant use of tizanidine with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is contraindicated.\r\nSide Effects\r\nWith low doses, such as those recommended for the relief of painful muscle spasms, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, blood pressure decrease, nausea, gastrointestinal disorder and transaminase increase have been reported, usually as mild and transient adverse reactions.\r\n \nWith the higher doses recommended for the treatment of spasticity, the adverse reactions reported with low doses are more frequent and more pronounced, but seldom severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the following adverse reactions may occur: hypotension, bradycardia, muscular weakness, insomnia, sleep disorder, hallucination & hepatitis.\r\nPsychiatric disorders: Common- Insomnia, sleep disorder.\r\nNervous system disorders: Very common- Somnolence, dizziness\r\nCardiac disorders: Uncommon- Bradycardia\r\nVascular disorders: Common- Hypotension\r\nGastrointestinal disorders: Very common- Gastrointestinal disorder, dry mouth; Common- Nausea.\r\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Very common- Muscular weakness\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Very common- Fatigue\r\nInvestigations: Common- Blood pressure decreased, transaminases increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAs there is limited experience with the use of Tizanidine in pregnant women, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.\r\n \nAnimal data: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/kg/day increased gestation duration. Prenatal and postnatal pup loss was increased and development retardation occurred. At these doses, dams showed marked signs of muscle relaxation and sedation. Based on body surface area, these doses were 2.2 and 6.7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg/day.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of tizanidine are excreted in rat milk. Since no human (fata are available Tizanidine should not be given to women who are breast-feeding.\r\n \nFemales and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing:  Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with Tizanidine.\r\n \nContraception: Females of reproductive potential should be advised that animal studies have been performed showing Tizanidine to be harmful to the developing fetus. Sexually-active females of reproductive potential are recommended to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1 % pregnancy rates) when using Tizanidine during treatment and for 1 day after stopping treatment with Tizanidine.\r\n \nFertility: Animal data: No impairment of fertility was observed in male rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, and in female rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Fertility was reduced in male rats receiving 30 mg/kg/day and in female rats receiving 10 mg/kg/day. Based on body surface area, these doses were 6.7 and 2.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.72 mg/kg. At these doses, maternal behavioral effects and clinical signs were observed including marked sedation, weight loss and ataxia.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCYP inhibitors: The concomitant use of Relentus with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is not recommended. Caution should be exercised when Relentus is given with drugs known to increase the QT interval.\r\n \nHypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Relentus and also as a result of drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors and/or antihypertensive drugs. Severe manifestations of hypotension such as loss of consciousness and circulatory collapse have also been observed.\r\n \nWithdrawal syndrome: Rebound hypertension and tachycardia have been observed after sudden withdrawal of Relentus, when it had been used chronically, and/or in high daily dosages, and/or concomitantly with antihypertensive drugs. In extreme cases, rebound hypertension might lead to cerebrovascular accident. Relentus should not be stopped abruptly, but rather gradually down titrated.\r\n \nHepatic dysfunction: Since hepatic dysfunction has been reported in association with tizanidine, but rarely at daily doses up to 12 mg, it is recommended that liver function tests should be monitored monthly for the first four months in patients receiving doses of 12 mg and higher and in patients who develop clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, anorexia or tiredness. Treatment with Relentus should be discontinued if serum levels of SGPT or SGOT are persistently above three times the upper limit of the normal range.\r\n \nPatients with renal impairment: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) systemic exposure to tizanidine may increase up to 6 times compared to patient with normal renal function. Therefore, it is recommended to start treatment at 2 mg once daily.\r\n \nHypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dermatitis, rash, urticarial, pruritis and erythema have been reported in association with tizanidine. Careful observation of the patient is recommended for one to two days after the first dose is administered. If anaphylaxis or angioedema with anaphylactic shock or difficulty of breathing is observed treatment with Relentus should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be instituted.\r\n \nDriving and using machines: Patients experiencing somnolence, dizziness or any signs or symptoms of hypotension should refrain from activities requiring a high degree of alertness, e.g. driving a vehicle or operating machines.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min): Maximal mean plasma levels were found to be twice as high as in normal volunteers, and the terminal half-life was prolonged to approximately 14 hours, resulting in much higher (approximately 6-fold on average) AUC values.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: No specific studies were conducted in this population. As tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP1A2 enzyme, hepatic impairment may increase its systemic exposure. Relentus is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\n \nGeriatrics (65 years of age and older): Pharmacokinetic data in this population are limited.\r\n \nGender: Gender has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.\r\n \nEthnicity: The impact of ethnic sensitivity and race on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been studied.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn the few reports of Relentus overdosage received, recovery was uneventful, including by a patient who ingested 400 mg Relentus. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, QT(c) prolongation, dizziness, somnolence, miosis, restlessness, respiratory distress, coma. It is recommended to eliminate the ingested drug by repeated administration of high doses of activated charcoal. Forced diuresis is expected to accelerate the elimination of Relentus. Further treatment should be symptomatic.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a dry place below 30\u00b0C. Relentus must be kept out of the reach and sight of children.",

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\rAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\rWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\rWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\rHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\rUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r\n \nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r\n \nHepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r\n \nRelated to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r\n \nManagement: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\nWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\r\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\r\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r\n \nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r\n \nHepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r\n \nRelated to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r\n \nManagement: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r\n \nRelated to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.",

Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature.

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\nIndications\r\nNaproxen & Esomeprazole is indicated for the relief of signs & symptoms of-\r\nOsteoarthritis\r\nRheumatoid arthritis\r\nAnkylosing spondylitis &\r\nTo decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis consists of an immediate release Esomeprazole Magnesium layer & an enteric-coated Naproxen core. As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r\n \nNaproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\r\nDosage\r\nCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r\n \nRheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\r\nAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\r\nWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\r\nWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet. This tablet is to be taken at least 30 minutes before meals.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nWith medicine:\r\nConcomitant use of NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, diuretics & beta-blockers\r\nConcomitant use of this tablet and warfarin may result in an increased risk of a bleeding complication.\r\nEsomeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion & may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg. Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\nWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\r\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\r\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility.

        "description": "Indications\rFebux tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Febux tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Febux on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Febux may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Febux with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Febux metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Febux. Febux can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Febux or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Febux. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Febux.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Febux can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Febux. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Febux .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Febux  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Febux  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Febux have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Febux. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Febux need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Febux than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Febux -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It may also act at intraspinal sites producing CNS depression. Baclofen also exerts an antinociceptive effect.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult & children over 10 years: 5 mg 3 times daily, preferably with or after food, gradually increased; max. 100 mg daily.\r Children <10 years: Treatment is usually started with 2.5 mg (2.5 ml) given 4 times daily then raised according to requirement. Daily maintenance dose-\r12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\r2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\r6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIncreased sedation may occur if Beclovan is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\rCombined treatment with Beclovan and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\rThe concomitant administration of Beclovan and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Beclovan resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\rIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Beclovan and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\rThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Beclovan may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\rCaution should be exercised when administering Beclovan and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.\rContraindications\rBaclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse reactions associated with Beclovan are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\rCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\rGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\rGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\rOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\rPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\rIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Beclovan may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued. Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Beclovan therapy or with overdose.\rBeclovan should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\rCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\rDuring treatment with Beclovan, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Beclovan should be used with caution in these circumstances.\rBeclovan has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\rAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.\rOverdose Effects\rGastric lavage is important in case of severe overdose.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nBeclovan is indicated in-\r\nspasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis\r\nflexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus and muscular rigidity\r\nskeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders\r\nspinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases\r\ncerebrovascular accidents or neoplastic or degenerative brain disease\r\nPharmacology\r\nBaclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level by stimulating the GABAB receptors, which inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate. It may also act at intraspinal sites producing CNS depression. Baclofen also exerts an antinociceptive effect.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult & children over 10 years: 5 mg 3 times daily, preferably with or after food, gradually increased; max. 100 mg daily.\r\n \nChildren <10 years: Treatment is usually started with 2.5 mg (2.5 ml) given 4 times daily then raised according to requirement. Daily maintenance dose-\r\n12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\r\n2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\r\n6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nIncreased sedation may occur if Beclovan is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\r\nCombined treatment with Beclovan and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\r\nThe concomitant administration of Beclovan and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Beclovan resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\r\nIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Beclovan and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\r\nThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Beclovan may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\r\nCaution should be exercised when administering Beclovan and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.\r\nContraindications\r\nBaclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reactions associated with Beclovan are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\r\nCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\r\nGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\r\nGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\r\nOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\r\nPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\r\nIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Beclovan may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued. Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Beclovan therapy or with overdose.\r\nBeclovan should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\r\nCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\r\nDuring treatment with Beclovan, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Beclovan should be used with caution in these circumstances.\r\nBeclovan has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\r\nAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nGastric lavage is important in case of severe overdose.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

These medicines reduce pain and inflammation and bring down a high temperature. Profen 5% gel is used to treat a number of painful conditions affecting the joints and muscles, such as backache, rheumatic and muscular pain, sprains, strains and sports injuries. It is also used to treat pain from non-serious arthritic conditions and nerve pain (neuralgia).\rPharmacology\rIbuprofen has a high level of anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic activity. The analgesic effects of Ibuprofen are due to both a peripheral and a central effect. Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which thus results in a marked reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen also inhibits the synthesis of some lipo-oxygenase products. Ibuprofen thus quickly relieves pain and stiffness, reduces swelling, and improves the movement of different joints of arthritis sufferers.\rDosage & Administration\rOral dosage form:\r Adults: The dose is initially, 400 mg 3 times daily. A dose of 2400 mg daily should not be exceeded.\r Children:\r3-6 months (body-weight over 5 kg): \u00bd tsp (2.5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r6 months-1 year: \u00bd tsp (2.5 ml) 3-4 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r1-4 years: 1 tsp (5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r4-7 years: 1\u00bd tsp (7.5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r7-10 years: 2 tsp (10 ml) 3 times daily; upto 30 mg/kg (max. 2.4 gm) daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r10-12 years: 3 tsp (15 ml) 3 times daily; upto 30 mg/kg (max. 2.4 gm) daily in 3-4 divided doses.\rchildren weighing less than 5 kg: Not recommended for children weighing less than 5 kg.\r In juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: up to 30-40 mg/kg of body weight daily in 3-4 divided doses may be taken or as directed by the physician.\r  Topical gel:\r Adults: Squeeze 4 to 10cm (i.e. 1.6 to 4 inches) of gel from the tube on affected area. Massage until absorbed. This dose should not be repeated more frequently than every four hours and no more than four times a day in any 24 hour period. The amount of gel squeezed would be equivalent to 50 to 125 mg of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen 5% gel should only be used on healthy, unbroken skin. Do not use it on or near cuts or grazes or under dressings such as plasters. Also, do not use it on the genital area. Do not let any gel come in contact with your eyes. If it does, rinse your eyes with cold water and consult your doctor. Hands should be washed after applying Ibuprofen 5% gel, unless they are the site of treatment.

Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\rFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\rFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\rFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\rNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r  Naproxen Suspension: Children:\r For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napro-A-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napro-A and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napro-A.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rNaproxen & Esomeprazole is indicated for the relief of signs & symptoms of-\rOsteoarthritis\rRheumatoid arthritis\rAnkylosing spondylitis &\rTo decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThis consists of an immediate release Esomeprazole Magnesium layer & an enteric-coated Naproxen core. As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. If a dose of Esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\r Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis-\rAdults: One tablet twice daily of either: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis in Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age & Older-\rWeight greater than 50 kg: 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole; or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole\rWeight 38 kg to less than 50 kg: One tablet twice daily of 375 mg naproxen/20 mg of esomeprazole.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rDo not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.

Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rNapro-A is indicated for the relief of sign and symptoms of-\rrheumatoid arthritis\rosteoarthritis\rankylosing spondylitis\rjuvenile arthritis\rtendonitis\rbursitis\racute gout\rIt is also indicated for the management of primary dysmenorrhea & pain.\rPharmacology\rAs with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\rFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\rFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\rFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\rNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r  Naproxen Suspension: Children:\r For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension:\r13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\r25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\r38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\r Naproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.\rAntacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Napro-A.\rAspirin: increase adverse effects.\rDiuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.\rMethotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.\rWarfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.\rSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.\rContraindications\rNaproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napro-A-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napro-A and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napro-A.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nNapro-A is indicated for the relief of sign and symptoms of-\r\nrheumatoid arthritis\r\nosteoarthritis\r\nankylosing spondylitis\r\njuvenile arthritis\r\ntendonitis\r\nbursitis\r\nacute gout\r\nIt is also indicated for the management of primary dysmenorrhea & pain.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAs with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r\n \nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\r\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\r\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\r\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\r\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\n \n \nNaproxen Suspension: Children:\r\n \nFor juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension:\r\n13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\r\n38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n \nNaproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.\r\nAntacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Napro-A.\r\nAspirin: increase adverse effects.\r\nDiuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.\r\nMethotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.\r\nWarfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nContraindications\r\nNaproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost frequently reported side effects include following:\r\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\r\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\r\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\r\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napro-A-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napro-A and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r\n \nHepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napro-A.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Fast overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Fast levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Fast are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Fast to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Fast-containing products concurrently. Fast should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Fast. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Fast may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Fast overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Fast overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Fast concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Fast. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Fast overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Fast levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Fast are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Fast to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Fast-containing products concurrently. Fast should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Fast. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Fast may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Fast overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Fast overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Fast concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Fast. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Fast overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Fast levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Fast are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Fast to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Fast-containing products concurrently. Fast should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Fast. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Fast may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Fast overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Fast overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Fast concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Fast. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Fast overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Fast concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Fast. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\r\nPharmacology\r\nParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r\nAce - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nTablet:\r\nAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\r\nChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

        "description": "Indications\rArth-A TS is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement. It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience.

But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\rSide Effects\rSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate. Glucosamine and Chondroitin has not been studied enough to determine their effects on a developing fetus. No studies have evaluated the use of Glucosamine and Chondroitin during pregnancy or lactation. It should be taken with caution and medical advice during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with Diabetes Mellitus are advised to monitor blood glucose levels regularly when taking Glucosamine. No special studies were formed in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. The toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile of Glucosamine and Chondroitin does not indicate limitations for these patients. However, administration to patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency should be under appropriate medical supervision.

        "description": "Indications\rArth-A is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement. It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience. Typical dosage recommendation, based on body weight is as follows-\rUnder 54 Kg: 1000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 800 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r54 Kg to 91 Kg: 1500 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1200 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\rOver 91 Kg: 2000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1600 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day.\r750/600 mg tablet: 1 tablet two times daily or as directed by the physician.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere have been no reports of significant drug interactions of Glucosamine and Chondroitin with Antibiotics/ Antidepressants/ Antihypertensives/ Nitrates/ Antiarrythmics/ Anxiolytics/ Hypoglycemic agents/ Antisecretives/ Antiasthmatics.

        "description": "Indications\rRheumatology: Inflammatory and degenerative forms of rheumatism, chronic involutive, polyarthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylarthroses, acute gout, peri-articular rheumatic disorders.\r Surgery and Traumatology: Sprain, bruises, dislocations, fractures, softtissue injuries, surgical interventions.\r Obstetrics and Gynecology: Primary dysmenorrhoea, episiotomy, adnexitis, endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, and mastitis.\r Otorhinolaryngology: As pre-operative medication for the prevention of pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r Dentistry: Post-operative and post-traumatic pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r Other indications: For the prevention of pain and treatment of inflammation and swelling of patients operated in the urogenital tract, renal and biliary colic.\rPharmacology\rDilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\rDosage & Administration\rDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r Diclofenac SR Tablet:\rAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\rChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\rElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\rDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\rAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\rChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.\rDiclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily.

At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. A-Fenac SR Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDuring pregnancy, Diclofenac should be employed only for compelling reasons. The lowest effective dose should be used. These types of drugs are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy. In view of insufficient clinical data, Diclofenac Sodium Gel is not recommended during pregnancy. A very insignificant quantity of Diclofenac may be detected in breast milk but no undesirable effects on the infant to be expected.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with A-Fenac SR. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation. A-Fenac SR Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light. Store below 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nRheumatology: Inflammatory and degenerative forms of rheumatism, chronic involutive, polyarthritis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylarthroses, acute gout, peri-articular rheumatic disorders.\r\n \nSurgery and Traumatology: Sprain, bruises, dislocations, fractures, softtissue injuries, surgical interventions.\r\n \nObstetrics and Gynecology: Primary dysmenorrhoea, episiotomy, adnexitis, endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, and mastitis.\r\n \nOtorhinolaryngology: As pre-operative medication for the prevention of pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r\n \nDentistry: Post-operative and post-traumatic pain, inflammation, and swelling.\r\n \nOther indications: For the prevention of pain and treatment of inflammation and swelling of patients operated in the urogenital tract, renal and biliary colic.\r\nPharmacology\r\nDilofenac Sodium is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pronounced anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has also some uricosuric effect. Diclofenac exerts its effect by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis which plays a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever. Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract when taken with or after meal. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within an average of 2 hours after ingestion of it. At therapeutic concentrations, it is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins. Diclofenac is metabolized in the liver and undergoes first pass metabolism.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDiclofenac FC Tablet: Adults: 75-150 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses, preferably after food. Dose should be reduced in long term use.\r\n \nDiclofenac SR Tablet:\r\nAdult: 1 tablet daily, taken whole with liquid, preferably at meal times. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased to 150 mg by supplementation with conventional tablets.\r\nChildren: 1-3 mg of diclofenac/kg body wt. daily in divided doses.\r\nElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, although the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium is not impaired to any clinically relevant extent in elderly patients.\r\nDiclofenac Dispersible Tablet:\r\nAdults: The recommended daily dosage is 2-3 tablets and the maximum daily dose is 150 mg. In milder cases, 2 tablets of Diclofenac DT per day are sufficient. Diclofenac DT should preferably be taken before meals.\r\nChildren: Diclofenac is not recommended in children for other indications except juvenile rheumatoid arthritis where the recommended dose is 1-3 mg/kg body weight. Diclofenac DT is to be dropped into a half-glass of water and the liquid is to be stirred to aid dispersion before swallowing. There is no information on the use of Diclofenac DT for more than 03 months.\r\nDiclofenac TR Capsule: One capsule daily. Diclofenac TR should be taken preferably after mealtimes.\r\n \nDiclofenac Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.\r\n \nDiclofenac injection: For adults the usual dose is 1 ampoule daily. In serious cases this dose may be increased up to 2 ampoules daily.\r\n \nDiclofenac Gel: For external use only. Depending on the size of area to be treated, 2-4 g of Diclofenac gel should be applied to the skin 3-4 times daily. To the affected area gel should be rubbed in lightly. This gel may also be given in addition to further treatment with other dosage forms of Diclofenac.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nA-Fenac SR may have the following drug interactions:\r\n \nLithium and digoxin: A-Fenac SR may increase plasma concentrations of lithium and digoxin.\r\n \nAnticoagulants: There are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage with the combined use of diclofenac and anticoagulant therapy, although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate any influence on anticoagulant effect.\r\n \nAntidiabetic agents: Clinical studies have shown that diclofenac can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect.\r\n \nCyclosporin: Cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving cyclosporin and diclofenac concomitantly.\r\n \nMethotrexate: Cases of serious toxicity have been reported when methotrexate and NSAIDs are given within 24 hours of each other.\r\n \nQuinolone antimicrobials: Convulsions may occur due to an interaction between quinolones and NSAIDs.\r\nTherefore, caution should be exercised when considering concomitant therapy of NSAID and quinolones.\r\n \nOther NSAIDs and steroids: Co-administration of diclofenac with other systemic NSAIDs and steroids may increase the frequency of unwanted effects. With aspirin, the plasma levels of each is lowered, although no clinical significance is known.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated to the patients hypersensitive to any ingredient of the products.

        "description": "Indications\rOxicam is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of the following painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system:\rRheumatoid arthritis.\rOsteoarthritis.\rArthrosis.\rAnkylosing spondylitis.\rExtra-articular disorders, e.g. tendinitis, bursitis, periarthritis of the shoulders (shoulder-hand syndrome) or hips, strains, and sprains.\rAcute gout.\rPharmacology\rTenoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties and it also inhibits platelet aggregation. Tenoxicam inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis. In-vitro tests of leukocyte peroxidase suggest that tenoxicam may act as a scavenger for active oxygen at the site of inflammation. Tenoxicam is a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human metalloproteinases (stromelysin and collagenase), which induce cartilage breakdown. These pharmacological effects explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefit of Tenoxicam in the treatment of painful inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Tenoxicam showed no mutagenic, carcinogenic or teratogenic effects in animals. As with other prostaglandin inhibitors, renal and gastrointestinal effects, increased incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition were observed in animal safety studies.\rDosage\rStandard dosage: For all indications except acute gout, a daily dosage of 20 mg should be given at the same time of day.\r In acute attacks of gout: The recommended dose for acute attacks of gout is 40 mg once daily for two days followed by 20 mg once daily for a further five days.\r In the treatment of chronic disorders: The therapeutic effect of tenoxicam is evident early in treatment but there is a progressive increase in response over time. In chronic disorders, daily doses higher than 20 mg should be avoided since this would increase the frequency and intensity of unwanted reactions without significantly increasing efficacy. For patients needing long-term treatment, a reduction to a daily oral dose of 10 mg may be tried for maintenance.\r Special dosage instructions: In principle, the above dosage recommendations also apply to elderly patients and to patients suffering from kidney or liver disease. Because of lack of clinical experience, no dosage recommendations have so far been established for children and adolescents.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThe tablets should be taken with a glass of water. It is preferable to take this medicine during or immediately after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAs in the case of other NSAIDs, salicylate displaces Oxicam from protein-binding sites and increases clearance and volume of distribution of Oxicam. Concurrent treatment with salicylate or other NSAIDs should be avoided because of increased risk of gastrointestinal undesirable reactions. The co-administration of some NSAIDs and methotrexate has been associated with reduced renal tubular secretion of methotrexate, higher plasma concentrations of methotrexate, and severe methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Oxicam is administered concurrently with methotrexate. No clinically relevant interaction was found in the small number of patients receiving concomitant treatment with gold, penicillamine or probenecid. As Oxicam may decrease the renal clearance of lithium, their concomitant administration may lead to increased plasma levels and toxicity of lithium. The plasma levels of lithium should be closely monitored. As with NSAIDs in general, Oxicam should not be administered concurrently with K-sparing diuretics. There is a known interaction between these two classes of compounds, which may cause hyperkalemia and renal failure. No clinically significant interaction between Oxicam and furosemide was noted, but Oxicam attenuates the blood pressure-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. As known from other NSAIDs, Oxicam might attenuate the antihypertensive effects of alpha-adrenergic blockers and ACE-inhibitors. No interactions have been reported between NSAIDs and centrally-acting alpha agonists or calcium channel blockers. There was no clinically relevant interaction when Oxicam was administered together with atenolol. During clinical trials no interaction was reported for patients treated concomitantly with digitalis products. Thus concurrent dosing of Oxicam and digoxin appears to be without major risk. No interaction has been found with concomitantly administered antacids, cimetidine, warfarin and phenprocoumon at the recommended dosages. The clinical effect of oral antidiabetic drugs (glibornuride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide) was likewise not modified by Oxicam. Nevertheless, careful monitoring is recommended when patients concomitantly receive anticoagulants or oral antidiabetic drugs. No clinically relevant interaction has been found between Oxicam and low molecular weight heparin.\rContraindications\rTenoxicam must not be administered to patients:\rknown to be hypersensitive to the drug;\rin whom salicylates or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria;\rsuffering or having suffered from the disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcer.\rSide Effects\rBased on clinical trials including large numbers of patients, Oxicam proved to be well tolerated in the recommended dose. Usually, the undesirable effects reported were mild and transient. In a small proportion of patients, the interruption of treatment due to undesirable effects was necessary. Local tolerance of Oxicam given parenterally was good. The following undesirable effects have been reported:\r Frequency is greater than 1%-\rGastrointestinal tract: gastric, epigastric and abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea.\rCentral nervous system: dizziness, headache.\rFrequency less than 1%-\rGastrointestinal tract: constipation, diarrhea, stomatitis, gastritis, vomiting, ulcers, Gl-bleeding including hematemesis and melena.\rCentral nervous system: fatigue, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, dry mouth, vertigo.\rSkin: itching (also in the anal region after rectal administration), erythema, exanthema, rash, urticaria.\rUrinary tract and kidneys: increase in BUN or creatinine, edema.\rLiver and biliary tract: increased liver enzyme activity.\rCardiovascular system: palpitations.\rIsolated cases (frequency less than 0.01%)-\rGastrointestinal tract: Gl-perforation.\rCentral nervous system: visual disturbances.\rSkin: Stevens-Johnson and Lyell's syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, vasculitis.\rBlood: anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.\rHypersensitivity reactions: dyspnea, asthma, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\rCardiovascular system: elevated blood pressure, mainly in patients treated with cardiovascular drugs.\rLiver/Biliary tract: hepatitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rNSAIDs have an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis and, when given during late pregnancy, may cause the closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, prolong labor and delay parturition. Treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Based on findings from single-dose administration, a very small amount (approximately 0.2%) of tenoxicam passes into breast milk. There is no evidence of adverse reactions in breast-fed infants of mothers taking Tenoxicam. Nevertheless, infants should be weaned or the drug discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and consequently may have an undesirable effect on renal hemodynamics and on salt and water balance. It is necessary to adequately monitor the patient with a special emphasis on cardiac and renal function (BUN, creatinine, development of edema, weight gain, etc.) when giving Oxicam to patients with conditions that could increase their risk of developing renal failure, such as pre-existing renal disease, impaired renal function in diabetics, hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, volume depletion or concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic drugs, diuretics and corticosteroids. Oxicam inhibits platelet aggregation and may affect hemostasis. Oxicam has no significant influence on blood coagulation factors, coagulation time, prothrombin time or activated thromboplastin time. Patients having coagulation disorders or receiving drug therapy that interferes with hemostasis should, however, be carefully observed when Oxicam is administered. Any patient being treated with Oxicam who presents with symptoms of gastrointestinal disease should be closely monitored. If peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, Oxicam should be immediately withdrawn. If severe skin reactions (e.g. Lyell's or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) occur, the treatment should be discontinued immediately. Adverse eye findings have been reported with Oxicam. Thus ophthalmic evaluation is recommended for patients who develop visual disturbances. Because of the high plasma protein binding of Oxicam, caution is required when plasma albumin levels are markedly reduced. In common with anti-inflammatory drugs, Oxicam may mask the usual signs of infection. Oxicam Tablets should not be given to patients who either dislike or do not tolerate milk products.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Children & adolescent: Oxicam is not recommended for use in patients under 16 years of age, as the dose and indications in this population have not been established.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Patients experiencing adverse events that might affect driving or using machines, such as vertigo, dizziness or visual disturbances should refrain from driving a car or using machines.\rOverdose Effects\rAlthough there is no experience of acute overdosage with Oxicam, it may be expected that the signs and symptoms mentioned under Undesirable effects would be more pronounced. Overdose should be countered by conventional measures to reduce absorption (e.g. gastrolavage and charcoal) and speed up elimination (e.g. cholestyramine).\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rFebus tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Febus tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\rPharmacology\rFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily. Febuxostat 120 mg tablet should be started two days before the beginning of cytotoxic therapy and continued for a minimum of 7 days. However treatment may be prolonged up to 9 days according to chemotherapy duration as per clinical judgment.\r Gout Flares: Gout flares may occur after initiation of Feboxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of Febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Feboxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient.\r Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary when administering Febuxostat in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMercaptopurine/Azathioprine: On the basis of the mechanism of action of Febus on XO inhibition concomitant use is not recommended. Inhibition of XO by Febus may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity.\r Rosiglitazone/CYP2C8 substrates: Co-administration of Febus with rosiglitazone or other CYP2C8 substrates is not expected to require any dose adjustment for those compounds.\r Naproxen and other inhibitors of glucuronidation: Febus metabolism depends on Uridine Glucuronosyl Transferase (UGT) enzymes. Medicinal products that inhibit glucuronidation, such as NSAIDs and probenecid, could in theory affect the elimination of Febus. Febus can be co-administered with naproxen with no dose adjustment of Febus or naproxen being necessary.\r Inducers of glucuronidation: Potent inducers of UGT enzymes might possibly lead to increased metabolism and decreased efficacy of Febus. Monitoring of serum uric acid is therefore recommended 1-2 weeks after start of treatment with a potent inducer of glucuronidation. Conversely, cessation of treatment of an inducer might lead to increased plasma levels of Febus.\r Colchicine/ Indometacin/ Hydrochlorothiazide/ Warfarin: Febus can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of Febus. No dose adjustment is necessary for hydrochlorothiazide or warfarin when administered with Febus .\r Antacids: Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of Febus  (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed. Therefore, Febus  may be taken without regard to antacid use.\rContraindications\rFebuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or theophylline.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to Febus have observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Febuxostat should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Febuxostat is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGout Flare: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including Febus. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, Febus need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months.\r Cardiovascular Events: A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with Febus than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke.\r Liver Enzyme Elevation: Transaminase elevations have been observed in Febus -treated patients. Monitor liver function tests periodically.\rOverdose Effects\rFebustat was studied in healthy subjects in doses up to 300 mg daily for seven days without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs used in Gout\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nFebus tablets are indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Febus tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\r\nPharmacology\r\nFebuxostat is a non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor. It decreases serum uric acid level by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for uric acid production. Xanthine oxidase breaks down hypoxanthine to xanthine and thus to uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended starting dose: Febuxostat 40 mg tablet once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2 weeks with Febuxostat 40 mg tablet, One Febuxostat 80 mg tablet once daily is recommended. If serum uric acid less than 6 mg per dL after 2-4 weeks with Xanuric 80 (Febuxostat 80mg) tablet, then one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily is recommended.\r\n \nTumor Lysis Syndrome: The recommended dose is one Febuxostat 120 mg tablet once daily.

Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\rFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\rFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\rFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\rNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r  Naproxen Suspension: Children:\r For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Anaflex-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Anaflex and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Anaflex.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r\n \nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\r\nFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals. The maintenance dose is usually 500 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12 - hour intervals. The total daily dose of Naproxen should not exceed 1000 mg maintaining 12-hour intervals.\r\nFor acute gout: 750 mg should be given initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has passed. Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\nFor dysmenorrhoea: For adults 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals for upto 5 days, if necessary.\r\nFor other indications like analgesia and acute musculoskeletal disorders: 500 mg should be given initially, followed by 250 mg at 6-8 hour intervals, if necessary.\r\nNaproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Children: Children under 16 years are not recommended.\r\n \n \nNaproxen Suspension: Children:\r\n \nFor juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: The usual dose for children over 2 years is 10 mg/kg/day given as two divided doses at 12-hour intervals. Therapy in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. The following may be used as a guide for dosage of suspension:\r\n13 kg (29 lb) 2.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n25 kg (55 lb) 5 mL b.i.d.\r\n38 kg (84 lb) 7.5 mL b.i.d.\r\n \nNaproxen Gel: Is to be applied 2-6 times a day as required and is not recommended for use in children.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.\r\nAntacids & Sucralfate: delay the absorption of Anaflex.\r\nAspirin: increase adverse effects.\r\nDiuretics: reduce the natriuretic effect of Furosemide and Thiazides.\r\nMethotrexate: enhance the toxicity of Methotrexate.\r\nWarfarin: increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): increase the risk of GI bleeding.\r\nContraindications\r\nNaproxen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Naproxen. It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost frequently reported side effects include following:\r\nGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\r\nDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\r\nCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\r\nOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Anaflex-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Anaflex and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r\n \nHepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Anaflex.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Anaflex-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Anaflex and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r\n \nHepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Anaflex.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rGabarol CR is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rGabarol CR CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Gabarol CR is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Gabarol CR should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Gabarol CR should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Gabarol CR, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Gabarol CR when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Gabarol CR may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Gabarol CR is rapidly discontinued. Gabarol CR should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Gabarol CR may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Gabarol CR and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Gabarol CR extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Gabarol CR, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\rAce - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\rChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\r\nPharmacology\r\nParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r\nAce - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nTablet:\r\nAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\r\nChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It inhibits the re uptake of neurotransmitters- serotonin and noradrenaline. Thus it modifies the transmission of pain impulses by activating both descending serotonergic pathways and noradrenergic pathways involved in analgesia. The analgesic effects of Tramadol are mediated via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors and indirect modulation of central monoaminergic inhibitory pathways.\rDosage & Administration\rCapsule or Tablet: Usual doses are 50 to 100 mg every four to six hours. For acute pain an initial dose of 100 mg is required. For chronic painful conditions an initial dose of 50 mg is recommended. Subsequent doses should be 50 to 100 mg administered 4-6 hourly. The dose level and frequency of dosing will depend on the severity of the pain.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Sustained Release Capsule or Tablet: One SR capsule or tablet every 12 hours, for example first one in the morning and then at the same time in the evening. The number of capsules taken at a time will depend upon severity of pain, but it should not be taken more frequently than every 12 hours.The total daily dosage by mouth should not exceed 400 mg.\r Injection: A dose of 50-100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hours by intramuscular or by intravenous infusion. For the treatment of postoperative pain,the initial dose is 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 10 to 20 minutes if necessary to a maximum of 250 mg in the first hour. Thereafter, doses are 50 to 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours up to a total daily dose of 600 mg.\r Suppository: Tramadol suppository should be administered rectally. For adults usual dose is 100 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride 6 hourly. In general, 400 mg Tramadol Hydrochloride (4 Tramadol suppository) per day sufficient. However, for the treatment of Cancer pain and severe pain after operations much higher daily doses can be used.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIn general, physician need not be concerned about drugs interacting with Winpain. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent the only drug class not recommended for combination with Winpain. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with Winpain causes a significant increase in Winpain metabolism and it requires to increase the dose of Winpain.\rContraindications\rTramadol is contraindicated in persons having hypersensitivity to this drug. It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.\rSide Effects\rCommonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRespiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.\r Opioid dependence: Winpain is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.\r Concomitant CNS depressants: Winpain should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.\r Concomitant MAO inhibitors: Winpain should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\r Winpain should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn children from the age of 1 year Winpain can be given in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight. However,suppository (100 mg Winpain) should not be administered in children and adolescents below the age of 14 years. Winpain 100 mg SR Capsules have not been studied in children.

However, for the treatment of Cancer pain and severe pain after operations much higher daily doses can be used.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nIn general, physician need not be concerned about drugs interacting with Winpain. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent the only drug class not recommended for combination with Winpain. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with Winpain causes a significant increase in Winpain metabolism and it requires to increase the dose of Winpain.\r\nContraindications\r\nTramadol is contraindicated in persons having hypersensitivity to this drug. It is also contraindicated in acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids or psychotropic drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommonly occurring side-effects are dizziness/vertigo, nausea, constipation, headache, somnolence, vomiting, pruritus, CNS stimulation, asthenia, sweating, dyspepsia, dry mouth, diarrhoea. Less commonly occurring side-effects include malaise, allergic reaction, weight loss, vasodilatation, palpitations, abdominal pain, anorexia, flatulence, GI bleeding, hepatitis, stomatitis etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafe use of Tramadol in pregnancy has not been established. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Tramadol Hydrochloride should not be administered during breast feeding as Tramadol and its metabolites have been detected in breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRespiratory depression: When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Therefore, tramadol should be administered cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression.\r\n \nOpioid dependence: Winpain is not recommended for patients who are dependent on opioids.\r\n \nConcomitant CNS depressants: Winpain should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administering to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics.\r\n \nConcomitant MAO inhibitors: Winpain should be used with great caution in patients taking MAO inhibitors, since tramadol inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\r\n \nWinpain should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury and patients with acute abdominal conditions.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn children from the age of 1 year Winpain can be given in a dose of 1-2 mg/kg body weight. However,suppository (100 mg Winpain) should not be administered in children and adolescents below the age of 14 years. Winpain 100 mg SR Capsules have not been studied in children. Therefore, safety and efficacy have not been established and the product should not be used in children.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOpioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rNabumetone is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Nabumetone and other treatment options before deciding to use Nabumetone. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals\rPharmacology\rNabumetone is a naphthylalkanone. Is is a non-selective prostaglandin G/H synthase (a.k.a. cyclooxygenase or COX) inhibitor that acts on both prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and -2). Prostaglandin G/H synthase catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin H2. Prostaglandin H2 is the precursor to a number of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling, inflammation, and platelet aggregation. The parent compound is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active compound, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA). The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis.\r The parent compound is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, most likely through binding to the COX-2 and COX-1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rOsteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended starting dose is 1,000 mg taken as a single dose with or without food. Some patients may obtain more symptomatic relief from 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg per day. Nabumetone can be given in either a single or twice-daily dose. Dosages greater than 2,000 mg per day have not been studied. The lowest effective dose should be used for chronic treatment.  Patients weighing under 50 kg may be less likely to require dosages beyond 1,000 mg; therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy, the dose should be adjusted to meet individual patients\u2019 requirements.\r Interaction\rReports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.\rContraindications\rNabumetone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to nabumetone or its excipients. Nabumetone should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergictype reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients. Nabumetone is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery\rSide Effects\rGastrointestinal: Diarrhea (14%), dyspepsia (13%), abdominal pain (12%), constipation, flatulence, nausea, positive stool guaiac, dry mouth, gastritis, stomatitis, vomiting.\r Central Nervous System: Dizziness, headache, fatigue, increased sweating, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence.\r Dermatologic: Pruritus, rash\r Special Senses: Tinnitus\r Miscellaneous: Edema\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nabumetone should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk, however 6MNA is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Nabumetone, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r Labor and Delivery: In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of Nabumetone on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNabumetone cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of Nabumetone in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms following acute NSAIDs overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.\r Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAIDs overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children), and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r There have been overdoses of up to 25 grams of Nabumetone reported with no long-term sequelae following standard emergency treatment (i.e., activated charcoal, gastric lavage, IV H2-blockers, etc.).\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 25\u00b0C; excursions permitted to 15-30\u00b0C in well-closed container; dispense in light-resistant container.\nIndications\r\nNabumetone is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Lyrinex CR is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Lyrinex CR should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Lyrinex CR should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Lyrinex CR, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Lyrinex CR when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Lyrinex CR may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Lyrinex CR is rapidly discontinued. Lyrinex CR should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Lyrinex CR may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Lyrinex CR and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Lyrinex CR extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Lyrinex CR, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00b0C), protected from light & moisture.

Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Lyrinex CR is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Lyrinex CR should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Lyrinex CR should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Lyrinex CR, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Lyrinex CR when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Lyrinex CR may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Lyrinex CR is rapidly discontinued. Lyrinex CR should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Lyrinex CR may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Lyrinex CR and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Lyrinex CR extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Lyrinex CR, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00b0C), protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThe indications of ketoprofen are based on its anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Ketoprofen is indicated for symptomatic treatment of:\rRheumatoid arthritis\rDegenerative joint diseases\rMusculoskeletal and joint disorders such as tendinitis, sprain\rPain, regardless of the origin, such as dental pain, headache and primary dysmenorrhea.\rPharmacology\rKetoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic actions. In addition to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, it stabilizes lysosomal membranes in vitro and in vivo, inhibits leukotriene synthesis in vitro at high concentrations, and also exhibits antibradykinin activity in vivo. Ketoprofen produces analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins peripherally and centrally. It has also been suggested that Ketoprofen causes the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS (probably in the hypothalamus) leading to its antipyretic effect.\r Ketoprofen is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract. It is approximately 99% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin. Following single or multiple oral doses in healthy adults, the elimination half-life of the drug has averaged 1.1-4 hours. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver, principally via conjugation with glucoronic acid. Following a single oral dose of Ketoprofen in healthy adults, about 50-90% of the drug is excreted in urine and about 1-8% in faeces within 1-5 days ; most urinary excretion occurs within 12-24 hours and most faecal excretion occurs within 24-48 hours. In case of IM injection, peak concentration of approximately 10 mg/L is reached at about 0.5-0.75 hour after a 100 mg dose. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.88 hour.\rDosage\rAnti-inflammatory dosage: The recommended starting dose is 150 to 300 mg/day in 3 divided doses. Once the maintenance dosage has been established (usually 100 to 200 mg/day), the patient may be tried on a twice daily dose regimen. Alternatively, switching to the once daily form at the same dosage may be considered. The recommended maximum daily dose is 300 mg.\r Management of pain and primary dysmenorrhea: The usual recommended dose is 25 to 50 mg, every 6 to 8 hours as necessary. The total daily dose should not exceed 300 mg.\r Administration\rThe oral forms should be taken with fluids, preferably with food.\r Interaction\rNot recommended drug associations Other NSAIDs (including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors) and high dose salicylates: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Anticoagulants Increased risk of bleeding.\rHeparin\rVitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin)\rPlatelet aggregation inhibitors (such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel)\rThrombin inhibitors (such as dabigatran)\rDirect factor Xa inhibitors (such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban)\rIf coadministration is unavoidable, patient should be closely monitored.\rLithium: Risk of elevation of lithium plasma levels, sometimes reaching toxic levels due to decreased lithium renal excretion. Where necessary, plasma lithium levels should be closely monitored and the lithium dosage levels adjusted during and after NSAID therapy.\rMethotrexate at doses greater than 15mg/week: Increased risk of haematologic toxicity of methotrexate, particularly if administered at high doses (>15 mg/week), possibly related to displacement of protein-bound methotrexate and to its decreased renal clearance.\rDrug associations requiring precautions for use Medicinal products and therapeutic categories that can promote hyperkalemia (i.e. potassium salts, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists, NSAIDs, heparins (low molecular-weight or unfractioned), cyclosporin, tacrolimus and trimethoprim): The risk of hyperkalemia can be enhanced when the drugs mentioned above are administered concomitantly.\rCorticosteroids: increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding.\rDiuretics: Patients and particularly dehydrated patients taking diuretics are at a greater risk of developing renal failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition. Such patients should be rehydrated before initiating co-administration therapy and renal function monitored when the treatment is started.\rACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: In patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients the co-administration of an ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin II antagonist and agents that inhibit cyclooxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.\rNicorandil: In patients concomitantly receiving nicorandil and NSAIDs, there is an increased risk for severe complications such as gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation and hemorrhage.\rCardiac glycosides: A pharmacokinetic interaction between ketoprofen and digoxin has not been demonstrated. However, caution is advised, in particular in patients with renal impairment, since NSAIDs may reduce renal function and decrease renal clearance of cardiac glycosides.\rCyclosporin: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\rTacrolimus: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\rMethotrexate at doses lower than 15mg/week: During the first weeks of combination treatment, full blood count should be monitored weekly. If there is any alteration of the renal function or if the patient is elderly, monitoring should be done more frequently.\rPentoxifylline: There is an increased risk of bleeding. More frequent clinical monitoring and monitoring of bleeding time is required.\rTenofovir: Concomitant administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and NSAIDs may increase the risk of renal failure.\rDrug associations to be taken into account Antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics): Risk of decreased antihypertensive potency (inhibition of vasodilator prostaglandins by NSAIDs).\rThrombolytics: Increased risk of bleeding. Probenecid: Concomitant administration of probenecid may markedly reduce the plasma clearance of ketoprofen.\rSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.\rContraindications\rKetoprofen is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions such as asthmatic attacks or other allergic-type reactions to ketoprofen, ASA or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic reactions have been reported in such patients. Ketoprofen is also contraindicated in the following cases:\rSevere heart failure\rActive or history of peptic ulcer/hemorrhage\rHistory of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAIDs therapy\rSevere hepatic insufficiency\rSevere renal insufficiency\rThird trimester of pregnancy\rRectitis or history of proctorrhagia (rectal administration)\rSide Effects\rBlood and lymphatic system disorders- Rare: haemorrhagic anaemia; Unknown: agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia\rImmune system disorders- Unknown: anaphylactic reactions (including shock) Psychiatric disorders; Unknown: depression, hallucinations, confusion, mood altered\rNervous system disorders- Uncommon: headache, dizziness, somnolence, Rare: paraesthesia; Unknown: aseptic meningitis, convulsions, dysgeusia, vertigo\rEye disorders- Rare: vision blurred\rEar and labyrinth disorders- Rare: tinnitus\rCardiac disorders- Unknown: exacerbation of heart failure, atrial fibrillation\rVascular disorders- Unknown: hypertension, vasodilatation, vasculitis (including leukocytoclastic vasculitis)\rRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders- Rare: asthma; Unknown: bronchospasm (particularly in patients with known hypersensitivity to ASA and other NSAIDs)\rGastrointestinal disorders- Common: dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting; Uncommon: constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, gastritis; Rare: stomatitis, peptic ulcer; Unknown: exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, pancreatitis\rHepatobiliary disorders- Rare: hepatitis, transaminases increased\rSkin and subcutaneous disorders- Uncommon: rash, pruritis; Unknown: photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, urticaria, angioedema, bullous eruption including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: renal failure acute, tubulointerstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, renal function tests abnormal\rGeneral disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: oedema Metabolism and nutritional disorders; Unknown: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia Investigations; Rare: weight increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDuring the first and second trimester: As the safety of ketoprofen in pregnant women has not been evaluated, the use of Ketoprofen during the first and second trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. During the third trimester of pregnancy: Prodenid is contraindicated during the last trimester of pregnancy. Ketoprofen is not recommended in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOral Forms: NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated. At the start of treatment, renal function must be carefully monitored in patients with heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrosis, in patients receiving diuretic therapy, in patients with chronic renal impairment, particularly if the patient is elderly. In these patients, administration of ketoprofen may induce a reduction in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition and lead to renal decomposition.\r Caution is required in patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy.\r Increased risk of atrial fibrillation has been reported in association with the use of NSAIDs.Hyperkalemia may occur, especially in patients with underlying diabetes, renal failure, and/or concomitant treatment with hyperkalemia promoting agents. Potassium levels must be monitored under these circumstances.\r As with other NSAIDs, in the presence of an infectious disease, it should be noted that the antiinflammatory, analgesic and the antipyretic properties of ketoprofen may mask the usual signs of infection progression such as fever.\r In patients with abnormal liver function tests or with a history of liver disease, transaminase levels should be evaluated periodically, particularly during long-term therapy. Rare cases of jaundice and hepatitis have been described with ketoprofen.\r If visual disturbances such a blurred vision occur, treatment should be discontinued. The use of NSAIDs may impair female fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of the NSAID should be considered.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\r Hepatic impairment: These patients should be carefully monitored and kept at the minimal effective daily dosage.\r Renal impairment: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\rOverdose Effects\rCases of overdose have been reported with doses up to 2.5 g of ketoprofen. In most instances, the symptoms observed have been benign and limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. There are no specific antidotes to ketoprofen overdosages. In cases of suspected massive overdosages, a gastric lavage is recommended and symptomatic and supportive treatment should be instituted to compensate for dehydration, to monitor urinary excretion and to correct acidosis, if present. If renal failure is present, hemodialysis may be useful to remove circulating drug.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rProtect from light.

It is approximately 99% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin. Following single or multiple oral doses in healthy adults, the elimination half-life of the drug has averaged 1.1-4 hours. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver, principally via conjugation with glucoronic acid. Following a single oral dose of Ketoprofen in healthy adults, about 50-90% of the drug is excreted in urine and about 1-8% in faeces within 1-5 days ; most urinary excretion occurs within 12-24 hours and most faecal excretion occurs within 24-48 hours. In case of IM injection, peak concentration of approximately 10 mg/L is reached at about 0.5-0.75 hour after a 100 mg dose. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.88 hour.\r\nDosage\r\nAnti-inflammatory dosage: The recommended starting dose is 150 to 300 mg/day in 3 divided doses. Once the maintenance dosage has been established (usually 100 to 200 mg/day), the patient may be tried on a twice daily dose regimen. Alternatively, switching to the once daily form at the same dosage may be considered. The recommended maximum daily dose is 300 mg.\r\n \nManagement of pain and primary dysmenorrhea: The usual recommended dose is 25 to 50 mg, every 6 to 8 hours as necessary. The total daily dose should not exceed 300 mg.\r\n \nAdministration\r\nThe oral forms should be taken with fluids, preferably with food.\r\n \nInteraction\r\nNot recommended drug associations Other NSAIDs (including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors) and high dose salicylates: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Anticoagulants Increased risk of bleeding.\r\nHeparin\r\nVitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin)\r\nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors (such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel)\r\nThrombin inhibitors (such as dabigatran)\r\nDirect factor Xa inhibitors (such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban)\r\nIf coadministration is unavoidable, patient should be closely monitored.\r\nLithium: Risk of elevation of lithium plasma levels, sometimes reaching toxic levels due to decreased lithium renal excretion. Where necessary, plasma lithium levels should be closely monitored and the lithium dosage levels adjusted during and after NSAID therapy.\r\nMethotrexate at doses greater than 15mg/week: Increased risk of haematologic toxicity of methotrexate, particularly if administered at high doses (>15 mg/week), possibly related to displacement of protein-bound methotrexate and to its decreased renal clearance.\r\nDrug associations requiring precautions for use Medicinal products and therapeutic categories that can promote hyperkalemia (i.e. potassium salts, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists, NSAIDs, heparins (low molecular-weight or unfractioned), cyclosporin, tacrolimus and trimethoprim): The risk of hyperkalemia can be enhanced when the drugs mentioned above are administered concomitantly.\r\nCorticosteroids: increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding.\r\nDiuretics: Patients and particularly dehydrated patients taking diuretics are at a greater risk of developing renal failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition. Such patients should be rehydrated before initiating co-administration therapy and renal function monitored when the treatment is started.\r\nACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: In patients with compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients the co-administration of an ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin II antagonist and agents that inhibit cyclooxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.\r\nNicorandil: In patients concomitantly receiving nicorandil and NSAIDs, there is an increased risk for severe complications such as gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation and hemorrhage.\r\nCardiac glycosides: A pharmacokinetic interaction between ketoprofen and digoxin has not been demonstrated. However, caution is advised, in particular in patients with renal impairment, since NSAIDs may reduce renal function and decrease renal clearance of cardiac glycosides.\r\nCyclosporin: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\r\nTacrolimus: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\r\nMethotrexate at doses lower than 15mg/week: During the first weeks of combination treatment, full blood count should be monitored weekly. If there is any alteration of the renal function or if the patient is elderly, monitoring should be done more frequently.\r\nPentoxifylline: There is an increased risk of bleeding. More frequent clinical monitoring and monitoring of bleeding time is required.\r\nTenofovir: Concomitant administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and NSAIDs may increase the risk of renal failure.\r\nDrug associations to be taken into account Antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics): Risk of decreased antihypertensive potency (inhibition of vasodilator prostaglandins by NSAIDs).\r\nThrombolytics: Increased risk of bleeding. Probenecid: Concomitant administration of probenecid may markedly reduce the plasma clearance of ketoprofen.\r\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.\r\nContraindications\r\nKetoprofen is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions such as asthmatic attacks or other allergic-type reactions to ketoprofen, ASA or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic reactions have been reported in such patients. Ketoprofen is also contraindicated in the following cases:\r\nSevere heart failure\r\nActive or history of peptic ulcer/hemorrhage\r\nHistory of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAIDs therapy\r\nSevere hepatic insufficiency\r\nSevere renal insufficiency\r\nThird trimester of pregnancy\r\nRectitis or history of proctorrhagia (rectal administration)\r\nSide Effects\r\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders- Rare: haemorrhagic anaemia; Unknown: agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia\r\nImmune system disorders- Unknown: anaphylactic reactions (including shock) Psychiatric disorders; Unknown: depression, hallucinations, confusion, mood altered\r\nNervous system disorders- Uncommon: headache, dizziness, somnolence, Rare: paraesthesia; Unknown: aseptic meningitis, convulsions, dysgeusia, vertigo\r\nEye disorders- Rare: vision blurred\r\nEar and labyrinth disorders- Rare: tinnitus\r\nCardiac disorders- Unknown: exacerbation of heart failure, atrial fibrillation\r\nVascular disorders- Unknown: hypertension, vasodilatation, vasculitis (including leukocytoclastic vasculitis)\r\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders- Rare: asthma; Unknown: bronchospasm (particularly in patients with known hypersensitivity to ASA and other NSAIDs)\r\nGastrointestinal disorders- Common: dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting; Uncommon: constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, gastritis; Rare: stomatitis, peptic ulcer; Unknown: exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, pancreatitis\r\nHepatobiliary disorders- Rare: hepatitis, transaminases increased\r\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders- Uncommon: rash, pruritis; Unknown: photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, urticaria, angioedema, bullous eruption including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: renal failure acute, tubulointerstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, renal function tests abnormal\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: oedema Metabolism and nutritional disorders; Unknown: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia Investigations; Rare: weight increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDuring the first and second trimester: As the safety of ketoprofen in pregnant women has not been evaluated, the use of Ketoprofen during the first and second trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. During the third trimester of pregnancy: Prodenid is contraindicated during the last trimester of pregnancy. Ketoprofen is not recommended in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nOral Forms: NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated. At the start of treatment, renal function must be carefully monitored in patients with heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrosis, in patients receiving diuretic therapy, in patients with chronic renal impairment, particularly if the patient is elderly. In these patients, administration of ketoprofen may induce a reduction in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition and lead to renal decomposition.\r\n \nCaution is required in patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy.\r\n \nIncreased risk of atrial fibrillation has been reported in association with the use of NSAIDs.Hyperkalemia may occur, especially in patients with underlying diabetes, renal failure, and/or concomitant treatment with hyperkalemia promoting agents. Potassium levels must be monitored under these circumstances.\r\n \nAs with other NSAIDs, in the presence of an infectious disease, it should be noted that the antiinflammatory, analgesic and the antipyretic properties of ketoprofen may mask the usual signs of infection progression such as fever.\r\n \nIn patients with abnormal liver function tests or with a history of liver disease, transaminase levels should be evaluated periodically, particularly during long-term therapy. Rare cases of jaundice and hepatitis have been described with ketoprofen.\r\n \nIf visual disturbances such a blurred vision occur, treatment should be discontinued. The use of NSAIDs may impair female fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of the NSAID should be considered.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: These patients should be carefully monitored and kept at the minimal effective daily dosage.\r\n \nRenal impairment: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nCases of overdose have been reported with doses up to 2.5 g of ketoprofen. In most instances, the symptoms observed have been benign and limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. There are no specific antidotes to ketoprofen overdosages. In cases of suspected massive overdosages, a gastric lavage is recommended and symptomatic and supportive treatment should be instituted to compensate for dehydration, to monitor urinary excretion and to correct acidosis, if present. If renal failure is present, hemodialysis may be useful to remove circulating drug.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nProtect from light. Store below 30\u00b0C. Do not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.",

Ketoprofen is also contraindicated in the following cases:\r\nSevere heart failure\r\nActive or history of peptic ulcer/hemorrhage\r\nHistory of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAIDs therapy\r\nSevere hepatic insufficiency\r\nSevere renal insufficiency\r\nThird trimester of pregnancy\r\nRectitis or history of proctorrhagia (rectal administration)\r\nSide Effects\r\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders- Rare: haemorrhagic anaemia; Unknown: agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, leucopenia\r\nImmune system disorders- Unknown: anaphylactic reactions (including shock) Psychiatric disorders; Unknown: depression, hallucinations, confusion, mood altered\r\nNervous system disorders- Uncommon: headache, dizziness, somnolence, Rare: paraesthesia; Unknown: aseptic meningitis, convulsions, dysgeusia, vertigo\r\nEye disorders- Rare: vision blurred\r\nEar and labyrinth disorders- Rare: tinnitus\r\nCardiac disorders- Unknown: exacerbation of heart failure, atrial fibrillation\r\nVascular disorders- Unknown: hypertension, vasodilatation, vasculitis (including leukocytoclastic vasculitis)\r\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders- Rare: asthma; Unknown: bronchospasm (particularly in patients with known hypersensitivity to ASA and other NSAIDs)\r\nGastrointestinal disorders- Common: dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting; Uncommon: constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, gastritis; Rare: stomatitis, peptic ulcer; Unknown: exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and perforation, pancreatitis\r\nHepatobiliary disorders- Rare: hepatitis, transaminases increased\r\nSkin and subcutaneous disorders- Uncommon: rash, pruritis; Unknown: photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, urticaria, angioedema, bullous eruption including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Renal and urinary disorders- Unknown: renal failure acute, tubulointerstitial nephritis, nephritic syndrome, renal function tests abnormal\r\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: oedema Metabolism and nutritional disorders; Unknown: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia Investigations; Rare: weight increased.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nDuring the first and second trimester: As the safety of ketoprofen in pregnant women has not been evaluated, the use of Ketoprofen during the first and second trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. During the third trimester of pregnancy: Prodenid is contraindicated during the last trimester of pregnancy. Ketoprofen is not recommended in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nOral Forms: NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated. At the start of treatment, renal function must be carefully monitored in patients with heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrosis, in patients receiving diuretic therapy, in patients with chronic renal impairment, particularly if the patient is elderly. In these patients, administration of ketoprofen may induce a reduction in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition and lead to renal decomposition.\r\n \nCaution is required in patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy.\r\n \nIncreased risk of atrial fibrillation has been reported in association with the use of NSAIDs.Hyperkalemia may occur, especially in patients with underlying diabetes, renal failure, and/or concomitant treatment with hyperkalemia promoting agents. Potassium levels must be monitored under these circumstances.\r\n \nAs with other NSAIDs, in the presence of an infectious disease, it should be noted that the antiinflammatory, analgesic and the antipyretic properties of ketoprofen may mask the usual signs of infection progression such as fever.\r\n \nIn patients with abnormal liver function tests or with a history of liver disease, transaminase levels should be evaluated periodically, particularly during long-term therapy. Rare cases of jaundice and hepatitis have been described with ketoprofen.\r\n \nIf visual disturbances such a blurred vision occur, treatment should be discontinued. The use of NSAIDs may impair female fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of the NSAID should be considered.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: These patients should be carefully monitored and kept at the minimal effective daily dosage.\r\n \nRenal impairment: It is advisable to reduce the initial dosage and maintain such patients on the minimal effective dose.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nCases of overdose have been reported with doses up to 2.5 g of ketoprofen. In most instances, the symptoms observed have been benign and limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. There are no specific antidotes to ketoprofen overdosages. In cases of suspected massive overdosages, a gastric lavage is recommended and symptomatic and supportive treatment should be instituted to compensate for dehydration, to monitor urinary excretion and to correct acidosis, if present. If renal failure is present, hemodialysis may be useful to remove circulating drug.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nProtect from light. Store below 30\u00b0C. Do not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.",

        "description": "Indications\rFor the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate local pain associated with muscle and/or joints injuries, e.g. sport injuries.\rPharmacology\rKetoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic actions. In addition to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, it stabilizes lysosomal membranes in vitro and in vivo, inhibits leukotriene synthesis in vitro at high concentrations, and also exhibits antibradykinin activity in vivo. Ketoprofen produces analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins peripherally and centrally. It has also been suggested that Ketoprofen causes the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS (probably in the hypothalamus) leading to its antipyretic effect.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: The gel should be applied on to the painful or inflamed area two to three times daily. The amount of gel should be adjusted so that it covers the painful area. The total daily dose shall not exceed 15 grams per day. The length of treatment should not exceed one week. The gel should be massaged onto the skin for a few minutes.\r Children: The safety and efficacy of Ketoprofen gel in children have not been established.\r Interaction\rInteractions are unlikely as serum concentrations following topical administration are low.\rContraindications\rKetoprofen gel must not be used in patients with:\rKnown hypersensitivity reactions, such as symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis or urticaria, to ketoprofen, fenofibrate, tiaprofenic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\rHistory of hypersensitivity to any of the excipients.\rHistory of photosensitivity reactions.\rHistory of cutaneous reactions to ketoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fenofibrate, UV blockers or perfumes.\rKetoprofen gel must not be used on pathological skin changes such as eczema or acne; or in infected skin or open wounds. Do not use Ketoprofen gel if you cannot avoid sun exposure, even hazy sun, including UV light from solarium, during treatment and for 2 weeks after its discontinuation.\rSide Effects\rImmune System disorders- Not known: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions.\r Gastrointestinal disorders- Although plasma levels after administration of Ketoprofen gel are much lower than those reached after oral administration, systemic gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and flatulence) are possible under rare circumstances depending on the amount of gel applied and the application of the gel to a large area of skin. Uncommon: Nausea. Not known: Abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence.\r Skin and Subcutaneous tissue disorders- Uncommon: Erythema, pruritus, eczema. Rare: Photosensitivity reactions, dermatitis bullous, urticaria. Localised skin reactions have been reported which may spread outside the application site. Not known: Burning sensations, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\r Renal and Urinary disorders- Very rare: Worsening renal insufficiency.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDuring the first and second trimester: As the safety of ketoprofen in pregnant women has not been evaluated, the use of Ketoprofen during the first and second trimester of pregnancy should be avoided.\rDuring the third trimester: During the third trimester of pregnancy, all prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors including ketoprofen may induce cardiopulmonary and renal toxicity in the fetus. At the end of the pregnancy, prolonged bleeding time in both mother and child may occur.\rKetoprofen is not recommended in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe gel should be used with caution in patients with reduced heart, liver or renal function.\rThe gel must not be used with occlusive dressings.\rThe gel must not come into contact with mucous membranes of the eyes.\rSerious skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), have been reported in association with the use of NSAIDs, including Ketoprofen Gel.

Chemically it is known as 5 benzoyle-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrroligine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2 - amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). Toramax inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins and may be considered as a peripherally acting analgesic. The biological activity of Toramax is associated with the S-form. Pharmacokinetic property of Toramax is linear. It is highly protein bound and is largely metabolized in liver. The products of metabolism and some unchanged drugs are excreted in the urine.\rPharmacology\rKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent analgesic of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme system and hence inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis. It demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose.\rDosage & Administration\rTablet: Recommended dose is 10 mg every 4-6 hours. It should be used short-term only (up to 7 days) and are not recommended for chronic use. Doses exceeding 40 mg/day is not recommended.\r Injection: Ketorolac injection may be used as a single or multiple doses, on a regular or when necessary schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering Ketorolac injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins within 30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.\r Single-Dose Treatment-\rIM Dosing (Adult):\rPatients <65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.\rPatients >65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.\rIV Dosing (Adult):\rPatients <65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.\rPatients >65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.\rIV or IM Dosing (2 to 16 years of age):\rIM Dosing: One dose of 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30 mg.\rIV Dosing: One dose of 0.5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 15 mg.\rMultiple-Dose Treatment (IV or IM)-\rPatients <65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg Ketorolac injection every 6 hours.

The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg. For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of Ketorolac Tromethamine.\rConversion from Parenteral to Oral Therapy: Ketorolac tablets may be used either as monotherapy or as follow-on therapy to parenteral Ketorolac. When Ketorolac tablets are used as a follow-on therapy to parenteral Ketorolac, the total combined daily dose of ketorolac (oral + parenteral) should not exceed 120 mg in younger adult patients or 60 mg in elderly patients on the day the change of formulation is made. On subsequent days, oral dosing should not exceed the recommended daily maximum of 40 mg. Ketorolac IM should be replaced by Ketorolac tablet as soon as feasible.

Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and adolescent over 16 years:\rOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\rPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\rSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWith medicine:\rOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Etocox was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\rDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\rAcetylsalicylic Acid: Etocox can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\rCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Etocox, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\rLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\rWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\rActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\rPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\rPregnancy and lactation.\rSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\rEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\rChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\rInflammatory bowel disease.\rCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\rPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\rEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Longpara overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Longpara levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Longpara are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Longpara to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Longpara-containing products concurrently. Longpara should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Longpara. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Longpara may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Longpara overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Longpara overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Longpara concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Longpara. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\r\nPharmacology\r\nParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r\nAce - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nTablet:\r\nAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\r\nChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

        "description": "Indications\rTory is indicated for the symptomatic relief of-\rOsteoarthritis (OA)\rRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\rAnkylosing spondylitis, and\rThe pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.\rFor the short-term treatment of moderate pain associated with dental surgery.\rTory - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rEtoricoxib is a potent, orally active cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitor within, and significantly above, the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions such as gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib (within the clinical dose range) decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased potential for Gl toxicity and effects on platelet aggregation. Etoricoxib produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily. Etoricoxib did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and adolescent over 16 years:\rOsteoarthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg once daily. In some patients with insufficient relief from symptoms, an increased dose of 60 mg once daily may increase efficacy.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAnkylosing spondylitis: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.\rAcute gouty arthritis: The recommended dose is 120 mg once daily. In clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis, Etoricoxib was given for 8 days.\rPostoperative dental surgery pain: The recommended dose is 90 mg once daily, limited to a maximum of 3 days.\rSome patients may require additional postoperative analgesia. As the cardiovascular risks of Etoricoxib may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWith medicine:\rOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Tory was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\rDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\rAcetylsalicylic Acid: Tory can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\rCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Tory, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\rLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\rWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\rActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\rPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\rPregnancy and lactation.\rSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\rEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\rChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\rInflammatory bowel disease.\rCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\rPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\rEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. It is not known whether Etoricoxib is excreted in human milk. Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\rPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with Tory after careful consideration.\rAdministration of Tory may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered.\rCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertension and in patients with pre-existing edema from any other reason.\rAny patients with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormalliver function test has occurred, should be monitored. If signs of hepatic insufficiency occur, or if persistently abnormal liver function tests (three times the upper limit of normal) are detected, Tory should be discontinued.\rTory should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\rTory may mask fever and other signs of inflammation. Caution should be exercised when co-administering Tory with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants.\rOverdose Effects\rAdministration of single doses of Tory up to 500 mg and multiple doses up to 150 mg/day for 21 days did not result in significant toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the Gl tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically, especially in patients with osteoarthritis.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nWith medicine:\r\nOral anticoagulants: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Tory was associated with an increase in prothrombin time.\r\nDiuretics, ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists: NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and other antihypertensive drugs.\r\nAcetylsalicylic Acid: Tory can be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid at doses used for cardiovascular prophylaxis (low-dose acetylsalicylic acid).\r\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus: Although this interaction has not been studied with Tory, coadministration of ciclosporin or tacrolimus with any NSAID may increase the nephrotoxic effect of ciclosporin or tacrolimus.\r\nLithium: NSAIDs decrease lithium renal excretion and therefore increase lithium plasma levels.\r\nWith food & others: Take without regards to meals.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\r\nActive peptic ulceration or active gastro-intestinai (Gl) bleeding.\r\nPatients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors.\r\nPregnancy and lactation.\r\nSevere hepatic dysfunction (serum albumin <25 g/l or Child-Pugh score 10).\r\nEstimated renal creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.\r\nChildren and adolescents under 16 years of age.\r\nInflammatory bowel disease.\r\nCongestive heart failure (NYHA ll-IV).\r\nPatients with hypertension whose blood pressure is persistently elevated above 140/90 mmHg and has not been adequately controlled.\r\nEstablished ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects may include palpitation, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, ecchymosis; less commonly dry mouth, taste disturbance, mouth ulcer, appetite and weight change, atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic attack, chest pain, flushing, cough, dyspnoea, epistaxis, anxiety, mental acuity impaired, paraesthesia, electrolyte disturbance, myalgia and arthralgia; very rarely confusion and hallucinations.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe use of Etoricoxib, as with any drug substance known to inhibit COX-2, is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. It is not known whether Etoricoxib is excreted in human milk. Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Women who use Etoricoxib must not breastfeed.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution is advised with treatment of patients most at risk of developing a gastrointestinal complication with NSAIDs; the elderly, patients using any other NSAID or acetylsalicylic acid concomitantly or patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and Gl bleeding.\r\nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with Tory after careful consideration.\r\nAdministration of Tory may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, and thereby impair renal function. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered.\r\nCaution should be exercised in patients with a history of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or hypertension and in patients with pre-existing edema from any other reason.\r\nAny patients with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormalliver function test has occurred, should be monitored. If signs of hepatic insufficiency occur, or if persistently abnormal liver function tests (three times the upper limit of normal) are detected, Tory should be discontinued.\r\nTory should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\r\nTory may mask fever and other signs of inflammation. Caution should be exercised when co-administering Tory with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAdministration of single doses of Tory up to 500 mg and multiple doses up to 150 mg/day for 21 days did not result in significant toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the Gl tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

As a result, Esomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the dissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine.\r Naproxen is a NSAID with analgesic & antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit the prostaglandin synthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/k+ -ATPase in the gastric parietal cell by acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity.\rDosage\rCarefully consider the potential benefits & risks of this tablet & other treatment options before deciding to use this tablet.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\rWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\rHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\rUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r Breast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r Older people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r Gastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r Renal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r Hepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r Related to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r Management: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r Related to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Ketoconazole, iron salts and digoxin).\r\nWith food & others: Administration of Naproxen & Esomeprazole together with high-fat food in healthy volunteers does not affect the extent of absorption of naproxen but significantly prolongs tmax by 10 hours and decreases peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 12%\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to any component of this tablet or substituted benzimidazoles.\r\nHistory of asthmay urticaria or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.\r\nUse during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\r\nSide Effects\r\nImmediate release esomeprazole has been included in the tablet formulation to decrease the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects from Naproxen. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet has been shown to significantly decrease the occurrence of gastric ulcers and NSAID associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events compared to Naproxen alone. Naproxen: Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of coxibs and some NSAIDs (particularly at high doses and in long-term treatment) may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (for example myocardial infarction or stroke). Although data suggest that the use of Naproxen (1000 mg daily) may be associated with a lower risk, some risk cannot be excluded. Oedema, hypertension and cardiac failure have been reported in association with NSAID treatment. The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. Peptic ulcers, perforation or GI bleeding, sometimes fatal, particularly in older people, may occur. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, melaena, haematemesis, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease have been reported following administration. Less frequently, gastritis has been observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: In women attempting to conceive or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be given unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.\r\n \nBreast-feeding: Naproxen is excreted in low quantities in human milk. It is unknown whether esomeprazole is excreted in human milk. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\n \nFertility: The use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may impair female fertility. The use of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet is not recommended in women attempting to conceive.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: The combination of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet and NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events. Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid. Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Risk-factors to develop NSAID related gastro-intestinal complications include high age, concomitant use of anticoagulants, corticosteroids, other NSAIDs including low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, debilitating cardiovascular disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and a history of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with the conditions such as Inducible porphyries, Systemic lupus erythematosis and mixed connective tissue disease, Naproxen should only be used after a rigorous benefit-risk ratio. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance.\r\n \nOlder people: Naproxen: Older people have an increased frequency of adverse reactions especially gastro-intestinal bleeding, and perforation, which may be fatal. The esomeprazole component of Naproxen and Esomeprazole tablet decreased the incidence of ulcers in older people.\r\n \nGastrointestinal effects: Naproxen: GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at anytime during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation with NSAIDs is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation, and in older people. These patients should begin treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents (e.g. misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) should be considered for these patients, and also for patients requiring concomitant low dose acetylsalicylic acid, or other drugs likely to increase gastrointestinal risk. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly older people, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially GI bleeding) particularly in the initial stages of treatment. Caution should be advised in patients receiving NSAIDs with concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as acetylsalicylic acid. When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving Naproxen and Esomeprazole Tablet, the treatment should be withdrawn. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as these conditions may be exacerbated. Esomeprazole: Dyspesia could still occur despite the addition of Esomperazole to the combination tablet. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Esomeprazole, as all acid-blocking medicines, might reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or achlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors of reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy.\r\n \nCardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects: Naproxen: Appropriate monitoring and advice are required for patients with a history of hypertension and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure as fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular disease should only be treated with Naproxen after careful consideration. Similar consideration should be made before initiating longer-term treatment of patients with risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).\r\n \nRenal effects: Naproxen: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients: Studies indicate that although the total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required & some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\r\n \nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal impairment: Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).\r\n \nHepatic insufficiency: Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely & consider a possible dose reduction based on the Naproxen component of this tablet. This is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment because Esomeprazole dosage should not exceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Related to Naproxen overdose- Significant Naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life-threatening.\r\n \nRelated to esomeprazole overdose- The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful.\r\n \nManagement: Related to Naproxen- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAID overdose, particularly with respect to GI effects and renal damage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of Naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\r\n \nRelated to Esomeprazole- No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialyzable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature of below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rPurifen is indicated in-\rThe relief of sign and symptoms of osteoarthritis.\rIndicated in rheumatoidal disorders such as osseous rheumatism, ankylosing spondilitis, juvenile arthritis, muscular rheumatism, degenerative joint diseases\rAcute symptomatic treatment of painful menstruation (primary dysmenorrhoea)\rCommon headache and fever\rSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain, such as muscle pain, headache and dental pain\rAs an adjuvant with common cold and influenza associated with headache.\rPharmacology\rDexibuprofen (S (+)-ibuprofen) is considered as the pharmacologically active enantiomer of racemic ibuprofen. Like racemic ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic action. Like ibuprofen, Dexibuprofen acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.\r Pharmacokinetics: Dexibuprofen is absorbed primarily from the small intestine. After metabolic transformation in the liver (hydroxylation, carboxylation) the pharmacologically inactive metabolites are completely excreted, mainly by the kidneys (90%), but also in the bile. The elimination half-life is 1.8-3.5 hours; the plasma protein binding is about 99%. Maximum plasma levels are reached about 2 hours after oral administration. The administration of dexibuprofen with a meal delays the time to reach maximum concentrations (from 2.1 hours after fasting conditions to 2.8 hours after non-fasting conditions) and decreases the maximum plasma concentrations (from 20.6 to 18.1 mcg/ml, which is of no clinical relevance), but has no effect on the extent of absorption.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dosage must be adjusted to the seriousness of the syndrome and the complaints of the patient. During chronic pain, the dosage must be adapted to the lowest effective dose.\r The recommended dosage: 600-900 mg Dexibuprofen per day, at 2-3 divided doses. The dosage can be raised temporarily up to 1200 mg Dexibuprofen per day in patients with acute disorders or exacerbations. The maximum daily dose is 1200 mg.\r At dysmenorrhea: A dosage of 600 up to 900 mg Dexibuprofen per day, at a divided dose.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThe reported drug interactions of Purifen are similar to that of racemic mixture of ibuprofen. Drug interactions is noticed with simultaneous use of anticoagulant, hydantoine and sulfonamide, ticlopidine, lithium, other NSAID's, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids, digoxin, methotrexate, pentoxyfiline, phenytoine, probenecid, sulfinpyrazon, sulfonylurea, thiazide and thiazide type diuretics, and zidovudine.\rContraindications\rDexibuprofen is contraindicated in patients with previous history of hypersensitivity to Dexibuprofen, or another NSAID, or any other component of the product. Patients, who experience attack of asthma, arouse bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, urticaria or edema after use of similar drugs (e.g. aspirin or other NSAID's). It is also contraindicated in patients with active or suspected hemorrhage, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, patients with serious heart diseases, kidney function impairment (GFR <30ml/min), and liver function impairment.\rSide Effects\rClinical experience has shown that adverse effects of Purifen are similar to those of racemic ibuprofen. Common side-effects are dyspepsia, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypersensitivity reactions - bleeding, ulcer.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Although no teratogennic impact has been observed in the animal-experimental research with dexibuprofen or ibuprofen, the use should be avoided during the pregnancy. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during late pregnancy should be avoided.\r Lactation: Studies at people have shown that racimic ibuprofen proceed in small to negligible degree in mother milk. So, Dexibuprofen should be used with cautions in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPurifen should be used with particular caution in patients with bronchial asthma or other chronic diseases of the pulmonary tract as well as in persons prone to allergy. The drug should be used in patients with hepatic, renal or cardiac insufficiency and with hypertension not responding to any treatment. Consultation with a doctor is recommended for patients with systemic lupus or with other autoimmunological disease before beginning therapy using the drug. Purifen should be used with extreme cautions in active and suspected hemorrhagic conditions such as gastro-duodenal ulcers, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, alcoholism. Allergic reactions to the drug may appear even for the first-time user and in such case, it should immediately be stopped.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impairment: Patients with mild to moderate liver function impairments must start with low amounts, and must closely be monitored. Purifen should not be used in patients with serious liver function impairments.\r Renal impairment: The start amount must be reduced at patients with mild to moderate kidney function impairments. Purifen cannot be used patients with serious kidney function impairments.\r Children Dose: Although Purifen is not licensed for use in children under 18 years of age in the UK, some countries permit such use. For example, in Switzerland, Purifen has been given to children aged 6 years and over at a dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg daily in 2-4 divided doses.\r For elderly people: Lowest effective dose is recommended. The dosage can be raised to adult dosage if well tolerated.\rOverdose Effects\rPurifen has low acute toxicities. Symptoms of toxicity occur at doses between 80 and 100 mg/kg body weight. Mild symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, tinnitus and ataxia. Moderate to serious symptoms, such as flatulence, hypotension, hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, reduced kidney function, coma, and apnoea. The treatment must be symptomatic: there is no specific antidote. In case of large quantities of Purifen, activated charcoal should be administered. Vomiting can be induced only when life-threatening quantities of the substance ingested and the procedure can be carried out within 60 minutes after ingestion. Dialysis and hemodialysis are of little value as Purifen binds strongly to plasma protein.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

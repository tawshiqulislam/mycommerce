        "description": "Indications\rNebita is indicated in-\rHypertension\rTreatment of essential hypertension\rChronic heart failure (CHF)\rTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\rPharmacology\rNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNebita should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Nebita should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebita may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebita and clonidine, Nebita should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebita is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebita should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebita is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebita should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebita be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebita should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebita should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebita was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebita is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebita can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebita has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebita has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebita is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisocor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisocor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisocor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisocor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Bisocor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisocor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily. If necessary, the dosage may be increased to 5/25 mg two tablets daily or as advised by the physicians. The dosage however should be individualized.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDisopyramide: Atenolol reduces the clearance of disopyramide by 20%.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesan was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rLopirel Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLopirel Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Lopirel Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Lopirel Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\n \nAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r\n \nAbsorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\r\nof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\r\nAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r\n \nAspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r\n \nHeparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\rPharmacology\rIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where Irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure. \r Elderly: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly\r Paediatric: Irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Cavapro.\r Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended.\r Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with Cavapro so far. Therefore, Cavapro is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid > 3 g/day and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Additional information on Cavapro interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r Lactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r Hyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\r\nPharmacology\r\nIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease.

        "description": "Indications\rDiltizem SR film-coated tablet is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic stable (classical) and vasopastic angina pectoris and has also been used alone or in combination in the management of hypertension, also, Diltizem SR is effective in myocardial infarction, coronary artery spasm, arrhythmias, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal motility disorder and migraine.\r Diltizem SR sustained release tablet is indicated in the prophylaxis and treatment of angina pectoris. It is used in the management of classical and vasospastic angina pectoris. It has also been used in the treatment of essential hypertension. It is used for prophylaxis of some selected supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\rPharmacology\rDiltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium channel antagonist. It is a peripheral and coronary vasodilator with some negative inotropic activity. Diltiazem inhibits cardiac conduction particularly at the sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. Diltiazem has the following actions:\r Antianginal: A direct dilatation of coronary arteries and arterioles proved oxygen supply to myocardial tissues. In addition dilatation of the peripheral vasculature reduces systemic pressure of cardiac \"after load\" which results in lessened stress and reduced oxygen requirements of the myocardial tissues.\r Antiarrhythmic: The inhibited influx of calcium ions in cardiac tissues result in slowed electrophysiological activity through the S-A and A-V nodes without affecting accessory bypass conduction or altering normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction.\r Antihypertensive: Reduces peripheral vascular resistance as a result of vasodilatation. More than 90% of an oral dose is rapidly absorbed. Protein binding is very high. Peak plasma concentration reaches within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolised in the liver and excreted (60%) through bile.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated formulation: The usual dose of Diltiazem Hydrochloride film coated tablet is 60 mg thrice daily. However patient's response may vary and dosage requirements can differ significantly between individual patients. If necessary, the divided dose may be increased to 180-300 mg/day.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated tablet-\r\nHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\r\nAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\r\nCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\r\nHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\r\nMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\r\nExtended-release tablet-\r\nHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\r\nAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\r\nHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\r\nIV Injection-\r\nArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\r\nIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\r\nMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\r\nContraindications\r\nAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\r\nSide Effects\r\nTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome: In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel with a single 300 mg (4 tablets) oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily.

It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Selomet in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Selomet has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Selomet concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Selomet. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Selomet may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Selomet should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Selomet have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Selomet cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Selomet in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Selomet has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated tablet-\r\nHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\r\nAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\r\nCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\r\nHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\r\nMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\r\nExtended-release tablet-\r\nHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\r\nAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\r\nHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\r\nIV Injection-\r\nArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\r\nIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\r\nMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Selomet concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Selomet. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\r\nContraindications\r\nAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\r\nSide Effects\r\nTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Selomet may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r\n \nMajor Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nHepatic impaired patient: Selomet should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r\n \nPediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Selomet have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Selomet cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rCorangi is indicated for the prevention and long-term treatment of angina pectoris.\rPharmacology\rNicorandil dilates arterioles and large coronary arteries by opening the potassium channels, and stimulates guanylate cyclase causing venous vasodilatation. It therefore reduces preload and afterload, and improves coronary blood flow.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual therapeutic range is 10 to 20 mg twice daily. The usual starting dose is 10 mg twice daily, in the morning and in the evening preferably, and should be titrated upwards in accordance with patients needs, response and tolerance up to 40 mg twice daily, if necessary. An even lower starting dose of 5 mg twice daily may be used in patients particularly prone to headache.\r Eldery: There are no special dosage requirements for elderly patients, but as with all medicines the lowest effective dose should be used. Nicorandil should be administered with care, using low starting dosages, in the elderly.\r Children: Not recommended.

Use is contra-indicated with cardiogenic shock and acute myocardial infarction with acute left ventricular failure and low filling pressures, in patients with hypotension, and in patients taking phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors because concurrent use of Nicorandil can lead to a serious drop in blood pressure. Warnings and precautions: Nicorandil should be used with caution in patients who may have blood volume depletion or in those who present with low systolic blood pressure (below 100 mm Hg). The use of the drug in patients with cardiogenic shock, or acute myocardial infarction with acute left ventricular failure and low filling pressures should be avoided. Nicorandil should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken if mouth ulceration, stomatitis or persistent or severe buccal ulcerations, appear. Caution is advised for the use of Nicorandil in patients with glaucoma. The hypotensive effect of other vasodilators, tricyclic antidepressants or alcohol can be increased by administration in combination with Nicorandil. Therapeutic doses of Nicorandil may lower the blood pressure of hypertensive patients and Nicorandil therefore, as with other antianginal agents, should be used with care when prescribed with antihypertensive drugs. Animal mutagenicify and carcinogenicity studies have not revealed any adverse effect of Nicorandil when used under experimental conditions.\rSide Effects\rHeadache (usually transitory), flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and weakness. Hypotension and reflex tachycardia at high doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough animal studies have not shown any harmful effect of Nicorandil to the foetus, has not been studied in human pregnancy. Use in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazard. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Nicorandil is administered to a nursing mother. Drug interactions: Although no pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic interaction has been obsen/ed in animal and human studies with Nicorandil associated with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, digoxin, a combination of digoxin/furosemide, rifampicin, and cimetidine, it is not excluded that the drug may nevertheless potentiate the effect of other vasodilators, tricyclic antidepressants and antihypertensive drugs administered concurrently, especially in combination with alcohol.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypovolaemia, low systolic BP, acute pulmonary oedema, pregnancy. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery.\rOverdose Effects\rln the case of overdosage, the likely symptomatology may be peripheral vasodilation with a fall in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. In such an event, monitoring of cardiac function and general supportive measures should be used. If not successful, circulating plasma volume should be increased by substitution of fluid. ln life-threatening situations, administration of vasopressors should be considered.\rTherapeutic Class\rPotassium-channel activator\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nCorangi is indicated for the prevention and long-term treatment of angina pectoris.\r\nPharmacology\r\nNicorandil dilates arterioles and large coronary arteries by opening the potassium channels, and stimulates guanylate cyclase causing venous vasodilatation.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\rPharmacology\rIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where Irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure. \r Elderly: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly\r Paediatric: Irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Cavapro.\r Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended.\r Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with Cavapro so far. Therefore, Cavapro is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid > 3 g/day and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Additional information on Cavapro interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r Lactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r Hyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension.

        "description": "Indications\rCardicor is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rCardicor is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Cardicor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Cardicor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Cardicor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg.

        "description": "Indications\rRipril indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in renal impairment:\rFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\rFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ripril and cause deterioration of renal function.\rContraindications\rRamipril must not be used\rin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\rin patients with a history of angioedema.\rconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\rin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\rin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\rwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\rwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\rduring pregnancy.\rConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\rSide Effects\rRipril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRipril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ripril.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ripril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ripril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ripril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ripril.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\nIndications\r\nRipril indicated in the following cases:\r\nHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\r\nTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\r\nTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\r\nReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\r\nPharmacology\r\nRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II.

Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\r\nFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ripril and cause deterioration of renal function.\r\nContraindications\r\nRamipril must not be used\r\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\r\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\r\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\r\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\r\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\r\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\r\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRipril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRipril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ripril.\r\n \nRenal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ripril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ripril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r\n \nPatients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ripril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ripril.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r\n \nManagement: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.",

        "description": "Indications\rRanolin XR is indicated for the treatment of chronic angina. Ranolin XR may be used with beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. It has been shown to decrease angina episodes in patients with coronary artery disease on maximal doses of amlodipine. Because Ranolin XR prolongs the QT interval, it should be reserved for patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other antianginal drugs.The effect on angina rate or exercise tolerance appeared to be smaller in women than men.\rPharmacology\rRanolazine has anti-ischemlc and antlanginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure.The exact mechanism of action of ranolazine is unknown. Ranolazine at therapeutic levels can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current (INa). However, the relationship of this inhibition to angina symptoms is uncertain. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr which prolongs the ventricular action potential.\r Absorption: Cmax: 2-5 h\rHalf-life: 6-22 h\rDistribution: Over the concentration range of 0.25 to 10 \u00b5g/ml, Ranolazine is approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins.\rMetabolism and Excretion: Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6. Ranolazine is metabolized rapidly and extensively in the liver and intestine; less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. Following a single oral dose of Ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dose is excreted in urine and 25% in feces.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate Ranolazine dosing at 500 mg twice daily and increase to 1000 mg twice daily, if needed, based on clinical symptoms. Take Ranolazine with or without meals. Swallow Ranolazine tablets whole; do not crush, break or chew. The maximum recommended daily dose of Ranolazine is 1000 mg twice daily.

Because of the potentiality for serious adverse reactions from ranolazine in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Ranolazine, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRanolin XR blocks QTc and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death.\r Co-administration of Ranolin XR with digoxin increases the plasma concentrations of digoxin by approximately 1.5-fold and the dose of digoxin may have to be reduced accordingly. The dose of other P-gp substrates may have to be reduced as well when Ranolin XR Is co-admlnistered. Caution should be exercised when co-adminlstering Ranolin XR with P-gp inhibitors such as ritonavir or cydosporine.\rOverdose Effects\rHigh oral doses of Ranolin XR produce dose-related increases in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. High intravenous exposure also produces diplopia, paresthesia, confusion, and syncope. In addition to general supportive measures, continuous ECG monitoring may be warranted in the event of overdose. Since Ranolin XR is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is unlikely to be effective in clearing Ranolin XR.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore Ranolin XR tablets at 25\u00b0C with excursion permitted to 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rNidipine SR is indicated in the management of all types of essential & renal hypertension. Also indicated in the management of hypertension during pregnancy & during coronary by pass surgery.\r Nidipine SR is also used for prophylaxis and the treatment of unstable & variant angina, myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischaemia. Moreover Nidipine SR is also used in Raynaud's phenomenon & heart failure.\rPharmacology\rNifedipine is an inhibitor of Calcium Channel Blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of Calcium ions into muscle cells. Nifedipine has selective effects as a dilator of arterial vessels. Nifedipine dilates main coronary and systemic arteries. As a result blood pressure falls and this elicits a sympathetic reflex response causing tachycardia and an increased cardiac output. Pulmonary arterial pressure also falls. Nifedipine has direct negative inotropic effects on cardiac muscles and these effects are seen at higher doses than dose which causes arterial vasodilatation.\rDosage & Administration\rNifedipine 10 mg:\rAngina: Initially 10 mg 3 times daily with food increased to 20 mg 3 times daily if necessary, in elderly patients, initially 5 mg 3 times daily.\rRaynaud's Phenomenon: 10 mg 3 times daily; maximum 60 mg daily. In urgent cases, the tablet should be dissolved under the tongue like a sublingual tablet. The effect occurs within some minutes.\rNifedipine 20 mg: The starting dose for patients, not previously prescribed Nifedipine products is one tablet once daily. The recommended dose in hypertension and angina prophylaxis is 20 mg twice daily during or after food. Dosage may be adjusted within the range 10 mg twice daily to 40 mg twice daily.\r Patients with liver dysfunction should commence therapy with 10 mg twice daily with careful monitoring.\r Patients with renal impairment do not require adjustment of dosage.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rACE inhibitors: Enhanced hypotensive effect.\rAnti-arrythmics: Plasma concentration of quinidine is reduced.\rAnti-bacterials: Rifampicin possibly increases metabolism of Nidipine SR.\rAnti-epileptics: Plasma concentration of phenytoin increases.\rAntipsychotics: Enhanced hypotensive effect.\r\u03b2-blockers: Occasionally severe hypotension and heart failure may occur.\rCyclosporin: Plasma concentration of Nidipine SR possibly increases.\rMuscle relaxants: Effect of muscle relaxants e.g. tubocurarine increases.\rUlcer healing drugs: Metabolism of Nidipine SR increases.\rContraindications\rCardiogenic shock, advanced aortic stenosis, nursing mothers, GI obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, hypotension.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, flushing, lethargy, gravitational oedema rash, nausea, increased frequency of micturation, eye pain, gum hyperplasia, depression, tremor, photosensitivity and few cases of jaundice have been reported. These reactions may regress on discontinuation of therapy. Its introduction may induce attacks of ischaemic pain in some patients with angina pectoris.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.

Nifedipine has direct negative inotropic effects on cardiac muscles and these effects are seen at higher doses than dose which causes arterial vasodilatation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nNifedipine 10 mg:\r\nAngina: Initially 10 mg 3 times daily with food increased to 20 mg 3 times daily if necessary, in elderly patients, initially 5 mg 3 times daily.\r\nRaynaud's Phenomenon: 10 mg 3 times daily; maximum 60 mg daily. In urgent cases, the tablet should be dissolved under the tongue like a sublingual tablet. The effect occurs within some minutes.\r\nNifedipine 20 mg: The starting dose for patients, not previously prescribed Nifedipine products is one tablet once daily. The recommended dose in hypertension and angina prophylaxis is 20 mg twice daily during or after food. Dosage may be adjusted within the range 10 mg twice daily to 40 mg twice daily.\r\n \nPatients with liver dysfunction should commence therapy with 10 mg twice daily with careful monitoring.\r\n \nPatients with renal impairment do not require adjustment of dosage.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: Enhanced hypotensive effect.\r\nAnti-arrythmics: Plasma concentration of quinidine is reduced.\r\nAnti-bacterials: Rifampicin possibly increases metabolism of Nidipine SR.\r\nAnti-epileptics: Plasma concentration of phenytoin increases.\r\nAntipsychotics: Enhanced hypotensive effect.\r\n\u03b2-blockers: Occasionally severe hypotension and heart failure may occur.\r\nCyclosporin: Plasma concentration of Nidipine SR possibly increases.\r\nMuscle relaxants: Effect of muscle relaxants e.g. tubocurarine increases.\r\nUlcer healing drugs: Metabolism of Nidipine SR increases.\r\nContraindications\r\nCardiogenic shock, advanced aortic stenosis, nursing mothers, GI obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, hypotension.\r\nSide Effects\r\nHeadache, flushing, lethargy, gravitational oedema rash, nausea, increased frequency of micturation, eye pain, gum hyperplasia, depression, tremor, photosensitivity and few cases of jaundice have been reported. These reactions may regress on discontinuation of therapy. Its introduction may induce attacks of ischaemic pain in some patients with angina pectoris.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nTablets should be swallowed whole and should not be bitten, chewed or broken up. It should be used with caution in patient whose cardiac reserve is poor. Should be withdrawn if ischaemic pain occurs or existing pain worsens shortly after initiating treatment. Use in diabetic patients requires adjustment of their control. Since the absorption of the drug could be modified by renal disease, caution should be exercised in treating such patients.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCalcium-channel blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nProtect from strong light, store in a cool place in the original pack\r\n",

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r\n \nAtenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily. If necessary, the dosage may be increased to 5/25 mg two tablets daily or as advised by the physicians. The dosage however should be individualized.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDisopyramide: Atenolol reduces the clearance of disopyramide by 20%. Additive negative inotropic effects on the heart may be produced.\r\n \nAmpicillin: at doses of 1 gm and above may reduce Atenolol levels.\r\n \nOral antidiabetics and insulin: Beta-blockers may decrease tissue sensitivity to insulin and inhibit insulin secretion e.g. in response to oral antidiabetics. Atenolol has less potential for these actions.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to either component, sinus bradycardia, second and higher degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, congestive heart failure, poor left ventricular function.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe combination of Amlodipine and Atenolol is well tolerated. Overall side-effects include\r\nfatigue, headache, edema, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety and depression.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe combination should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential fetal risk. The combination should not be used by nursing mothers. If its use is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be stopped.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronchospasm: The combination should be used with caution in patients with airway obstruction.\r\n \nRenal impairment: The combination can be used in patients with renal impairment. However, caution may be necessary if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min because of possible reduction in the excretion of unchanged Atenolol.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Caution may be necessary in the use of the combination in patients with severe liver damage because of prolongation of the elimination half-life of Amlodipine.\r\n \nDrug withdrawal: Since coronary heart disease may exist without being recognized, patients should be warned against stopping the drug suddenly.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBisocor Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bisocor Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bisocor Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Bisocor Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bisocor Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Bisocor Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated in the treatment of essential hypertension where blood pressure is not adequately controlled on perindopril alone.\rPharmacology\rPerindopril is a nonsulphydryl ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension. Following oral administration, perindopril is rapidly hydrolysed to perindoprilat, its principal active metabolite. ACE catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE activity leads to decreased levels of angiotensin II, thereby resulting in decreased vasoconstriction and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter change may result in a small increase in serum potassium. Decreased levels of angiotensin II and the accompanying lack of negative feedback on renal renin secretion results in increases in plasma renin activity. Perindopril administration may interfere with the degradation of the vasodepressor peptide bradykinin. It is not known whether this effect contributes to the therapeutic activity of perindopril. The mechanism through which perindopril lowers BP appears to result primarily from suppression of the RAAS.\r Indapamide is a sulphonamide derivative with an indole ring, pharmacologically related to the thiazide group of diuretics. Indapamide inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in the cortical diluting segment. It increases the urinary excretion of sodium and chlorides and, to a lesser extent, the excretion of potassium and magnesium, thereby increasing urine output and having an antihypertensive action.\rDosage & Administration\r1-2 tablets per day preferably taken in the morning before a meal.

        "description": "Indications\rCoversyl is a long-acting ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitor and is indicated in-\rEssential hypertension,\rStable coronary artery disease,\rCongestive heart failure.\rPharmacology\rPerindopril is an ACE inhibitor. It works by blocking the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ACE produces angiotensin II, as part of the body's natural control of blood pressure. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict and narrow, which increases the pressure within the blood vessels. Perindopril blocks the action of ACE, it reduces the production of angiotensin II, thus allows the blood vessels to relax and widen. The overall effect of this is a drop in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: One Perindopril 4 tablet once daily preferably in the morning. If necessary, the dose may be increased to 8 mg after 1 month of treatment. Perindopril should be taken before food.\r Stable coronary artery disease: Perindopril 4 once daily for two weeks, then increased to 8 mg once daily, depending on renal function and provided that the 4 mg dose is well tolerated. Elderly patients should receive Perindopril 2 mg once daily for one week, then Perindopril 4 once daily the next week, before increasing the dose up to 8 mg once daily, depending on renal, function. The dose should be increased only if the previous lower dose is well tolerated.\r Congestive heart failure: Perindopril should be started under close medical supervision at a starting dose of 2 mg in the morning.

        "description": "Indications\rCoveram is indicated as substitution therapy for the treatment of hypertension and/or stable coronary heart disease in patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril and amlodipine, given concurrently at the same dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with Coveram.\rPharmacology\rPerindopril, a pro-drug, is hydrolyzed to perindoprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor, which stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with an increase in serum potassium \r Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses.\rDosage & Administration\rperindopril arginine & amlodipine is as substitution therapy for patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril (5 or 10 mg) and amlodipine (5 or 10 mg), given concurrently at the dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with this combination.\r Food intake may reduce hepatic biotransformation of perindopril to perindoprilat. Recommended treatment is one tablet per day as a single dose, preferably to be taken in the morning and before a meal. As perindopril and amlodipine may be used for different clinical indications, dose adjustments should be based on clinical judgment and the individual patient profile.\r Adjustments can be made by decreasing or increasing the dose of either perindopril and/or amlodipine using separate perindopril and/or amlodipine products within the recommended dose range until clinical stability is re-established. Consult the Product Information of the individual perindopril and/or amlodipine products being used when adjusting the dose.\r In the event that down-titration is required, adjustments using amlodipine 2.5 mg or a dose of perindopril equivalent to perindopril arginine 2.5 mg, as separate products should be considered until clinical stability is re-established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBaclofen may increase the antihypertensive effect of Coveram. Monitor blood pressure and renal function, and adjust the dose of Coveram if necessary. Combined use of these medicines may increase the hypotensive effects of perindopril and amlodipine. Combined use with nitroglycerine and other nitrates or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood pressure and therefore should be considered with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated:\rIn patients with a history of previous hypersensitivity to either of the active ingredients; perindopril or amlodipine, ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridines or excipient ingredients present in this combination.\rDuring pregnancy and for lactating women.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with perindopril and amlodipine given separately are: oedema, somnolence, dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of the treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual impairment (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, flushing, hypotension (and effects related to hypotension), dyspnoea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change of bowel habit, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritus, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue, asthenia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThis combination should not be initiated during pregnancy and lactation. Patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with this combination should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative treatment should be started.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs Coveram contains lactose monohydrate, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption, or total lactase deficiency should not take Coveram.\r Since ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation resulting in decreased production of aldosterone, increases in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors including perindopril. Serum electrolytes (including sodium potassium and urea) should be measured from time to time when ACE inhibitors are given especially in combination with diuretics.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric use: Use of Coveram in children is not recommended as no data establishing safety or effectiveness in children are available.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a dry place below 25\u2070C.

Combined use with nitroglycerine and other nitrates or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood pressure and therefore should be considered with caution.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis combination is contraindicated:\r\nIn patients with a history of previous hypersensitivity to either of the active ingredients; perindopril or amlodipine, ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridines or excipient ingredients present in this combination.\r\nDuring pregnancy and for lactating women.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with perindopril and amlodipine given separately are: oedema, somnolence, dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of the treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual impairment (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, flushing, hypotension (and effects related to hypotension), dyspnoea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change of bowel habit, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritus, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue, asthenia.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis combination should not be initiated during pregnancy and lactation. Patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with this combination should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative treatment should be started.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs Coveram contains lactose monohydrate, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption, or total lactase deficiency should not take Coveram.\r\n \nSince ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation resulting in decreased production of aldosterone, increases in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors including perindopril. Serum electrolytes (including sodium potassium and urea) should be measured from time to time when ACE inhibitors are given especially in combination with diuretics.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPaediatric use: Use of Coveram in children is not recommended as no data establishing safety or effectiveness in children are available.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a dry place below 25\u2070C. Keep the container tightly closed and protect from light.\r\n",

It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rPlagrin Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPlagrin Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Plagrin Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Plagrin Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed.

Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rOlmedip - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor.

Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\rDosage & Administration\rHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r Very High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r Dosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r Use with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRemarkable drug interactions of Rovast are-\rCyclosporine: Combination increases Rovast exposure. Rovast dose should be limited to 5 mg once daily.\rGemfibrosil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, Rovast dose should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\rLopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases Rovast exposure. Rovast dose should be to 10 mg once daily.\rCoumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs international normalized ratio (INR). Stable INR should be achieved prior to starting Rovast. INR should be monitored frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of Rovast therapy.\rConcomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates and niacin products may increase the risk of skeletal muscle effects.\rContraindications\rRosuvastatin is contraindicated if-\rKnown hypersensitivity to product components\rLiver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels\rPregnant women and women who may become pregnant\rNursing mothers\rSide Effects\rRovast is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rovast were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRovast should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rovast may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rovast therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rovast therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of Rovast.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30oC temperature, protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmicard is indicated in-\r Hypertension: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.\rCardiovascular prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\rAtherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) or\rType 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\rTelpro - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-ll receptor antagonist. Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis.

Protect from light and high humidity. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nTelmicard is indicated in-\r\n \nHypertension: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.\r\nCardiovascular prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\r\nAtherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) or\r\nType 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\r\nTelpro - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nTelmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-ll receptor antagonist. Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\r\nCo-administration with aliskiren with Telmicard: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Telmicard tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r\n \nFor patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Telmicard tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

        "description": "Indications\rRamicard indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in renal impairment:\rFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\rFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramicard and cause deterioration of renal function.\rContraindications\rRamipril must not be used\rin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\rin patients with a history of angioedema.\rconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\rin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\rin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\rwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\rwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\rduring pregnancy.\rConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\rSide Effects\rRamicard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRamicard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramicard.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramicard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramicard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light.

If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRamicard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramicard.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramicard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramicard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\nIndications\r\nRamicard indicated in the following cases:\r\nHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\r\nTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\r\nTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\r\nReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\r\nPharmacology\r\nRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\r\nDosage\r\nDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r\n \nHypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r\n \nCongestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r\n \nPrevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r\n \nDosage in renal impairment:\r\nFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\r\nFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramicard and cause deterioration of renal function.\r\nContraindications\r\nRamipril must not be used\r\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\r\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\r\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\r\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\r\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\r\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\r\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRamicard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy.

        "description": "Indications\rNebifast is indicated in-\rHypertension\rTreatment of essential hypertension\rChronic heart failure (CHF)\rTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\rPharmacology\rNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNebifast should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Nebifast should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebifast may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebifast and clonidine, Nebifast should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebifast is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebifast should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebifast is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebifast should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebifast be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebifast should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebifast should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebifast was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebifast is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebifast can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Nebifast should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebifast has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Nebifast should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebifast has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebifast is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rDivastin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and triglycerides levels in following diseases when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate.\rTo reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.\rTo reduce elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in patient with mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ia and Ib).\rFor the treatment of patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridaemia (Fredrickson Type IV).\rFor the treatment of patients with dysbetalipoproteinaemia (Fredrickson Type III).\rTo reduce cardiac ischaemic events in patients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate symptomatic coronary artery disease with elevated LDL-cholesterol level.\rTo reduce total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with or exacerbated by diabetes mellitus or renal transplantation.\rPharmacology\rAtorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.\r Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.\r Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.\r Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\r Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rPrimary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-\rAdults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.\rFamilial hypercholesterolaemia-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.\rPrevention of cardiovascular events-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.\r Another guideline: \r The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\r In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThe risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.\r Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.\r Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.\r Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\r Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.\r Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\r Warfarin: Divastin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.\rContraindications\rAtorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\rSide Effects\rDivastin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to Divastin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant\r Lactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Divastin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. Divastin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of Divastin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.\r Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\r Gender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with Divastin between men and women.\r Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of Divastin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.\r Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of Divastin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of Divastin are markedly increased.\rOverdose Effects\rSpecific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rDivastin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and triglycerides levels in following diseases when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate.\rTo reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.\rTo reduce elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in patient with mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ia and Ib).\rFor the treatment of patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridaemia (Fredrickson Type IV).\rFor the treatment of patients with dysbetalipoproteinaemia (Fredrickson Type III).\rTo reduce cardiac ischaemic events in patients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate symptomatic coronary artery disease with elevated LDL-cholesterol level.\rTo reduce total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with or exacerbated by diabetes mellitus or renal transplantation.\rPharmacology\rAtorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.\r Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.\r Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.\r Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\r Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rPrimary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-\rAdults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.\rFamilial hypercholesterolaemia-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.\rPrevention of cardiovascular events-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.\r Another guideline: \r The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\r In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThe risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.\r Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.\r Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.\r Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\r Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.\r Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\r Warfarin: Divastin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.\rContraindications\rAtorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\rSide Effects\rDivastin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to Divastin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant\r Lactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Divastin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. Divastin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of Divastin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.\r Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\r Gender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with Divastin between men and women.\r Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of Divastin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.\r Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of Divastin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of Divastin are markedly increased.\rOverdose Effects\rSpecific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is active against most gram negative aerobic bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin is also active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including penicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin resistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are relatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of Ciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase needed for the synthesis of bacterial DNA. Following oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the G.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The half life is about 3.5 hours. About 30% to 50% of an oral dose of Ciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged drug and biologically active metabolites.\rDosage\rGeneral dosage recommendations: The dosage of the Ciprofloxacin is determined by the severity and type of infection, the sensitivity of the causative organism(s) and the age, weight and renal function of the patient.\r Adults: The dosage range for adults is 100-750 mg twice daily.\r In infections of the lower and upper urinary tract (depending on severity): 250-500 mg twice daily.\r In respiratory tract infections: 250-500mg twice daily for both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, depending on the severity. For the treatment of known Streptococcus pneumonia infection, the recommended dosage is 750 mg twice daily.\r In gonorrhea: A single dose of 250 or 500 mg.\r In the majority other infections: 500-750 mg twice daily should be administered.\r Cystic fibrosis: In adults with pseudomonal infections of the lower respiratory tract , the normal dose is 750 mg twice daily. As the pharmacokinetics of Ciprofloxacin remain unchanged in patients with cystic fibrosis, the low body weight of these patients would be fallen into consideration when determining dosage.\r Impaired renal function: Dosage adjustment is not usually required except in patients with several renal impairment. (serum creatinine >265 micro mol/l or creatinine clearance <20 ml/minute). If adjustment is necessary, this may be achieved by reducing the total daily dose by half, although monitoring of drug serum levels provide the most reliable basis for dose adjustment.\r Elderly: Although higher Ciprofloxacin serum levels are found in the elderly, no adjustment of dosage is necessary.\r Adeloscents and children: As with other drugs in its class, Ciprofloxacin has been shown to cause arthropathy in weight bearing joints of immature animals. Although the relevance of this to man is unknown, its use in children, growing children and growing adolescents is not recommended. However, where the benefit of using Ciprofloxacin is considered to outweigh the potential risk, the dosage should be 7.5-15 mg/kg/day depending upon the severity of infection, administered in two divided doses.\r Duration of treatment: The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection, clinical response and bacteriological findings.\r For acute infections: The usual treatment period is 5 to 10 days with Ciprofloxacin tablets. Generally treatment should be continued for three days after the signs and symptoms of the infection have disappeared.\r Extended-release tablet:\rIn uncomplicated urinary tract infection (acute cystitis), the recommended dose of extended-release tablet is 1000 mg tablet once daily for three days.\rFor IV infusion:\rUrinary Tract Infection: Mild to Moderate: 200 mg 12 hourly for 7-14 days; Severe or Complicated: 400 mg 12 hourly for 7-14 days\rLower Respiratory Tract infection: Mild to Moderate: 400 mg 12 hourly for 7-14 days; Severe or Complicated: 400 mg 8 hourly for 7-14 days\rNosocomial Pneumonia: Mild/Moderate/Severe: 400 mg 8 hourly for 10-14 days\rSkin and Skin Structure: Mild to Moderate: 400 mg 12 hourly for 7-14 days; Severe or Complicated: 400 mg 8 hourly for 7-14 days\rBone and Joint Infection: Mild to Moderate: 400 mg 12 hourly for more than 4-6 weeks; Severe/Complicated: 400 mg 8 hourly for more than 4-6weeks\rIntraabdominal (Acute abdomen): Complicated: 400 mg 12 hourly for 7-14 days\rAcute Sinusitis: Mild/Moderate: 400 mg 12 hourly for 10 days\rChronic Bacterial Prostatitis: Mild/Moderate: 400 mg 12 hourly for 28 Days.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rInstruction for the use of Ciprofloxacin IV infusion-\rCheck the bag for minute leaks by squeezing the inner bag firmly.

It is used in the management of classical and vasospastic angina pectoris. It has also been used in the treatment of essential hypertension. It is used for prophylaxis of some selected supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\rPharmacology\rDiltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium channel antagonist. It is a peripheral and coronary vasodilator with some negative inotropic activity. Diltiazem inhibits cardiac conduction particularly at the sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. Diltiazem has the following actions:\r Antianginal: A direct dilatation of coronary arteries and arterioles proved oxygen supply to myocardial tissues. In addition dilatation of the peripheral vasculature reduces systemic pressure of cardiac \"after load\" which results in lessened stress and reduced oxygen requirements of the myocardial tissues.\r Antiarrhythmic: The inhibited influx of calcium ions in cardiac tissues result in slowed electrophysiological activity through the S-A and A-V nodes without affecting accessory bypass conduction or altering normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction.\r Antihypertensive: Reduces peripheral vascular resistance as a result of vasodilatation. More than 90% of an oral dose is rapidly absorbed. Protein binding is very high. Peak plasma concentration reaches within 30-60 minutes.

Store in a cool and dry place.\nIndications\r\nCardizem film-coated tablet is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic stable (classical) and vasopastic angina pectoris and has also been used alone or in combination in the management of hypertension, also, Cardizem is effective in myocardial infarction, coronary artery spasm, arrhythmias, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal motility disorder and migraine.\r\n \nCardizem sustained release tablet is indicated in the prophylaxis and treatment of angina pectoris. It is used in the management of classical and vasospastic angina pectoris. It has also been used in the treatment of essential hypertension. It is used for prophylaxis of some selected supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r\nPharmacology\r\nDiltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium channel antagonist. It is a peripheral and coronary vasodilator with some negative inotropic activity. Diltiazem inhibits cardiac conduction particularly at the sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. Diltiazem has the following actions:\r\n \nAntianginal: A direct dilatation of coronary arteries and arterioles proved oxygen supply to myocardial tissues. In addition dilatation of the peripheral vasculature reduces systemic pressure of cardiac \"after load\" which results in lessened stress and reduced oxygen requirements of the myocardial tissues.\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic: The inhibited influx of calcium ions in cardiac tissues result in slowed electrophysiological activity through the S-A and A-V nodes without affecting accessory bypass conduction or altering normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction.\r\n \nAntihypertensive: Reduces peripheral vascular resistance as a result of vasodilatation. More than 90% of an oral dose is rapidly absorbed. Protein binding is very high. Peak plasma concentration reaches within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolised in the liver and excreted (60%) through bile.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated formulation: The usual dose of Diltiazem Hydrochloride film coated tablet is 60 mg thrice daily. However patient's response may vary and dosage requirements can differ significantly between individual patients. If necessary, the divided dose may be increased to 180-300 mg/day. Dosage may be started as 30 mg four times daily and increasing at 1 to 2 days intervals until the optimum response is achieved. Higher doses upto 480 mg/day have been used with benefit in some patients especially in unstable angina. Elderly and patients with impaired hepatic or renal function: The recommended starting dose is 60 mg twice daily. The heart rate should be measured regularly and the dose should not be increased if the heart rate falls below 50 beats per minute.\r\n \nSustained release formulation:\r\n \nMild to moderate hypertension: initially 90 mg or 120 mg twice daily (elderly once daily); up to 360 mg daily may be required (elderly upto 240 mg) daily.\r\nAngina: initially 90 mg or 120 mg twice daily in divided doses may be required (elderly up to 240 mg daily).\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant prophylactic therapy with short-or long-acting nitrates may be administered safely during diltiazem therapy.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc-XR in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc-XR has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc-XR concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc-XR. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc-XR may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc-XR should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc-XR have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc-XR cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\r\nIV Injection-\r\nArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\r\nIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\r\nMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc-XR concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc-XR. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\r\nContraindications\r\nAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\r\nSide Effects\r\nTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc-XR may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r\n \nMajor Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc-XR should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r\n \nPediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc-XR have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc-XR cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.",

It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlocard may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlocard used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlocard is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlocard have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlocard should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r In clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r The following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rPregnancy & lactation.\rBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\rSide Effects\rDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\rHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\rTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\rHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\rAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\rMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\rOverdose Effects\rTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity.

Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r\n \nTelmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r\n \nIn clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r\n \nThe following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nPregnancy & lactation.\r\nBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\r\nHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\r\nTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\r\nHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\r\nAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\r\nMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nAmiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telma Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised before taking Telma Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telma Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telma Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telma Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children. Keep in a cool and dry place. Protect from light.\nIndications\r\nTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telma Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\r\nPharmacology\r\nTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r\n \nThere is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r\n \nTelmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nBlockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\r\nTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\r\nHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\r\nTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCaution should be exercised before taking Telma Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telma Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telma Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telma Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor.

It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\r\nIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\r\nNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\r\nSevere Hypertension:\r\nThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\r\nFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r\n \nAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r\n \nOther antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r\n \nCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\r\nContraindications\r\nThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\r\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\r\nHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\r\nImpaired renal function and\r\nSymptomatic hypotension\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r\n \nUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesan was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials.

Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rOdrel Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOdrel Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Odrel Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Odrel Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\n \nAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r\n \nAbsorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\r\nof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\r\nAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r\n \nAspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r\n \nHeparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation.

        "description": "Indications\rNitrocard sublingual spray is indicated for acute relief of an attack or prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.\rDescription\rNitrocard, an organic nitrate, is a vasodilator which has effects on both arteries and veins. This is a metered dose spray containing Nitrocard. Nitrocard delivers Nitrocard (400 mcg per spray, 200 metered sprays) in the form of spray droplets under the tongue.\rPharmacology\rThe principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a vasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and veins with more prominent effects on the latter. Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load).\rDosage\rAt the onset of an attack, 1 or 2 metered sprays should be administered under the tongue. No more than 3 metered sprays are recommended within a 15 minute period. If the chest pain persists, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitroglycerin spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities which might precipitate an acute attack.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rSpecial Instructions:\rIn the case of angina patients, it is important to carry Nitroglycerin Spray all times (We recommend keeping a second supply at home on a bedside table or wherever it can be reached easily).\rThis drug is not for routine use. It is only to be used at the onset of chest pain.\rDo not drink alcoholic beverages after taking this medication.\rDo not take sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil while using any nitroglycerin product. Using these drugs together can result in a severe lowering of blood pressure, loss of consciousness, heart attack or death.\rKeep in a safe place away from children.\rHow to use Nitroglycerin spray:\rSit down if possible as soon as you feel an attack of angina coming on.\rRemove the plastic cap, do not shake the container.\rHold the container upright with forefinger on top of the button.\rOpen the mouth and bring the container as close to it as possible, aiming it under the tongue.\rPress the button slowly on the top of the container to spray under the tongue.\rRelease button and close mouth.

Hypotension, hypovolaemia, severe anaemia, cerebral haemorrhage and brain trauma, mitral stenosis and angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Concomitant administration of phosphodiesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.\rSide Effects\rA number of nitrate related adverse effects may occur including headache, facial flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feelings of weakness, postural hypotension and reflex tachycardia .\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Nitroglycerin spray is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe use of Nitrocard during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to monitoring hemodynamics and clinical status. Nitrocard should be used with caution in patients with severely impaired renal or hepatic function, hypothyroidism, malnutrition or hypothermia.\rUse in Special Populations\rSafety and effectiveness of Nitrocard in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rNitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse, heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions and possibly death due to circulatory collapse.\r Methemoglobinemia: Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin.\r Treatment of Overdosage: Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required. If an excessive quantity of Nitrocard spray has been recently swallowed, gastric lavage may be of use.\rTherapeutic Class\rNitrates: Coronary vasodilators\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place away from light and heat.

Concomitant administration of phosphodiesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nA number of nitrate related adverse effects may occur including headache, facial flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feelings of weakness, postural hypotension and reflex tachycardia .\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Nitroglycerin should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. It is not known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Nitroglycerin spray is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nThe use of Nitrocard during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to monitoring hemodynamics and clinical status. Nitrocard should be used with caution in patients with severely impaired renal or hepatic function, hypothyroidism, malnutrition or hypothermia.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nSafety and effectiveness of Nitrocard in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse, heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions and possibly death due to circulatory collapse.\r\n \nMethemoglobinemia: Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin.\r\n \nTreatment of Overdosage: Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required. If an excessive quantity of Nitrocard spray has been recently swallowed, gastric lavage may be of use.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNitrates: Coronary vasodilators\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place away from light and heat. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesartan Medoxomil & Hydrochlorothiazide combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rEcosprin Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEcosprin Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Ecosprin Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Ecosprin Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\n \nAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r\n \nAbsorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\r\nof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\r\nAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r\n \nAspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r\n \nHeparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r\n \nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r\n \nWarfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\r\nSide Effects\r\nEcosprin Plus is generally well tolerated.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nEcosprin Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\r\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Ecosprin Plus.\r\nReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms.

        "description": "Indications\rEssential hypertension: Calvasc is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Calvasc is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Calvasc is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Calvasc and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Calvasc and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Calvasc and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Calvasc did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Calvasc.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Calvasc may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Calvasc used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Calvasc is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Calvasc have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Calvasc should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

        "description": "Introduction\r Cardotel 5/40 contains two medicines, both of which help to control high blood pressure. It lowers the blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels and making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. This will reduce your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. Cardotel 5/40 may be taken on an empty stomach or along with food. However, it is better to take it regularly at a fixed time each day, as prescribed by your doctor. The dose will depend on your condition and how you respond to the medicine. It's important to keep taking this medicine even if you feel well. By lowering your blood pressure, it is reducing your risk of heart attack or stroke so do not stop taking it unless your doctor tells you to. You can help this medicine work better by making a few changes to your lifestyle such as keeping active, stopping smoking, and eating a low salt and low fat diet. The most common side effects of this medicine include swelling in your ankles or feet (oedema), headache, sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and upset stomach. Since it may cause sleepiness and dizziness, do not drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you. Talk to your doctor if any of the side effects bother you or will not go away. Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have any kidney or liver problems or severe dehydration. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it. While using this medicine, your blood pressure will need to be checked often and your kidney function may also need to be tested.\r Uses of Cardotel 5/40\r Hypertension (high blood pressure)\rSide effects of Cardotel 5/40\r Common\rSleepiness\rAnkle swelling\rHeadache\rFlushing (sense of warmth in the face, ears, neck and trunk)\rDizziness\rTiredness\rPalpitations\rUpset stomach\rIncreased potassium level in blood\rHow to use Cardotel 5/40\r Take this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. Swallow it as a whole. Do not chew, crush or break it. Cardotel 5/40 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time.\r How Cardotel 5/40 works\r Cardotel 5/40 is a combination of two medicines: Telmisartan and Amlodipine. Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). They work by relaxing the blood vessels and making the heart more efficient at pumping blood throughout the body. Together, they lower blood pressure effectively.\r  quick tips\rQuick Tips\rCardotel 5/40 is a combination of two medicines that provides better blood pressure control than either medicine alone.\rCardotel 5/40 may cause dizziness or sleepiness. Do not drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you.\rIt may cause you to feel lightheaded or weak especially when you stand up. Rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down.\rAvoid consuming alcohol as it may enhance the blood pressure lowering effect of this medicine.\rIt can cause ankle or foot swelling. Raise your legs while you are sitting down and talk to your doctor if it does not go away.\rDo not take Cardotel 5/40 if you are pregnant, planning to conceive or breastfeeding.\r description\rBrief Description\rIndication\r Hypertension Initial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on Telmisartan/Amlodipine tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. OR Substitute for individually titrated components May increase dose after at least 2 weeks, not to exceed 80 mg/10 mg qDay Dosage range: Telmisartan 20-80 mg/amlodipine 2.5-10 mg PO qDay Initial therapy with Telmisartan/Amlodipine is not recommended in patients ?75 years old or with hepatic impairment. Hepatic Impairment Severe impairment: Titrate slowly; dose adjustment not recommended May be administered concomitantly with other anti-hypertensive agents\r Administration\r Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation.

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.

It lowers the blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels and making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. This will reduce your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. Cardotel 5/40 may be taken on an empty stomach or along with food. However, it is better to take it regularly at a fixed time each day, as prescribed by your doctor. The dose will depend on your condition and how you respond to the medicine. It's important to keep taking this medicine even if you feel well. By lowering your blood pressure, it is reducing your risk of heart attack or stroke so do not stop taking it unless your doctor tells you to. You can help this medicine work better by making a few changes to your lifestyle such as keeping active, stopping smoking, and eating a low salt and low fat diet. The most common side effects of this medicine include swelling in your ankles or feet (oedema), headache, sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and upset stomach. Since it may cause sleepiness and dizziness, do not drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you. Talk to your doctor if any of the side effects bother you or will not go away. Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have any kidney or liver problems or severe dehydration. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it. While using this medicine, your blood pressure will need to be checked often and your kidney function may also need to be tested.\r\n \nUses of Cardotel 5/40\r\n \nHypertension (high blood pressure)\r\nSide effects of Cardotel 5/40\r\n \nCommon\r\nSleepiness\r\nAnkle swelling\r\nHeadache\r\nFlushing (sense of warmth in the face, ears, neck and trunk)\r\nDizziness\r\nTiredness\r\nPalpitations\r\nUpset stomach\r\nIncreased potassium level in blood\r\nHow to use Cardotel 5/40\r\n \nTake this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. Swallow it as a whole. Do not chew, crush or break it. Cardotel 5/40 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time.\r\n \nHow Cardotel 5/40 works\r\n \nCardotel 5/40 is a combination of two medicines: Telmisartan and Amlodipine. Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). They work by relaxing the blood vessels and making the heart more efficient at pumping blood throughout the body. Together, they lower blood pressure effectively.\r\n \n \nquick tips\r\nQuick Tips\r\nCardotel 5/40 is a combination of two medicines that provides better blood pressure control than either medicine alone.\r\nCardotel 5/40 may cause dizziness or sleepiness. Do not drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you.\r\nIt may cause you to feel lightheaded or weak especially when you stand up. Rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down.\r\nAvoid consuming alcohol as it may enhance the blood pressure lowering effect of this medicine.\r\nIt can cause ankle or foot swelling. Raise your legs while you are sitting down and talk to your doctor if it does not go away.\r\nDo not take Cardotel 5/40 if you are pregnant, planning to conceive or breastfeeding.\r\n \ndescription\r\nBrief Description\r\nIndication\r\n \nHypertension Initial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on Telmisartan/Amlodipine tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. OR Substitute for individually titrated components May increase dose after at least 2 weeks, not to exceed 80 mg/10 mg qDay Dosage range: Telmisartan 20-80 mg/amlodipine 2.5-10 mg PO qDay Initial therapy with Telmisartan/Amlodipine is not recommended in patients ?75 years old or with hepatic impairment. Hepatic Impairment Severe impairment: Titrate slowly; dose adjustment not recommended May be administered concomitantly with other anti-hypertensive agents\r\n \nAdministration\r\n \nAmlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.\r\n \nAdult Dose\r\n \nMay increase frequency and/or severity of angina during treatment initiation or dosage increments. Heart failure or hepatic impairment. Avoid fetal or neonatal exposure Hypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension. Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment Heart failure: Monitor for worsening Avoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker Myocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina Lactation: Discontinue drug or do not breast feed\r\n \nChild Dose\r\n \nPregnancy Category: C (1st trimester); D (2nd & 3rd trimesters)\r\n \nRenal Dose\r\n \nTelmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype.

        "description": "Indications\rRostab is indicated for:\rPatients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, non HDL-C and TG levels and to increase HDL-C.\rPatients with hypertriglyceredemia as an adjunct to diet.\rPatients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct to diet.\rPatients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL-C, total-C, and ApoB.\rSlowing the progression of atherosclerosis as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C as an adjunct to diet.\rPediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C and ApoB after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy.\rRisk reduction of Myocardial Infarction (MI), stroke and arterial revascularization procedures in patients without clinically evident CHD, but with multiple risk factors.\rRosu - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\rDosage & Administration\rHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r Very High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r Dosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r Use with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRemarkable drug interactions of Rostab are-\rCyclosporine: Combination increases Rostab exposure. Rostab dose should be limited to 5 mg once daily.\rGemfibrosil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, Rostab dose should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\rLopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases Rostab exposure. Rostab dose should be to 10 mg once daily.\rCoumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs international normalized ratio (INR). Stable INR should be achieved prior to starting Rostab. INR should be monitored frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of Rostab therapy.\rConcomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates and niacin products may increase the risk of skeletal muscle effects.\rContraindications\rRosuvastatin is contraindicated if-\rKnown hypersensitivity to product components\rLiver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels\rPregnant women and women who may become pregnant\rNursing mothers\rSide Effects\rRostab is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rostab were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRostab should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rostab may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rostab therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rostab therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of Rostab.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30oC temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Therefore, when given together they produce additive or synergistic diuretic. The Furosemide component inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter in the ascending Loop of Henle and blocks the reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride ions; thereby increasing the quantity of sodium and the volume of water excreted in the urine. This characteristically induces potassium loss. The spironolactone component inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at the distal tubule by antagonising the action of aldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly favoured and the excess loss of potassium, induced by the Furosemide, is reduced\rDosage & Administration\rFurosemide 20 and spironolactone 50 mg: 1 to 4 tablets daily (20 to 80 mg of Furosemide and 50 to 200 mg of spironolactone) according to the patient\u2019s response.\r Furosemide 40 and spironolactone 50 mg: For previously stabilized patients requiring a higher dosage of spironolactone and Furosemide, This tablet can be used at a dose of one to two tablets daily (Furosemide 40 to 80 mg and spironolactone 50 to 100 mg).\r Use in children: Spironolactone and Furosemide is not suitable for use in children.

Spironolactone increases the levels of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin in the blood and this may result in digitalis toxicity. Corticosteroids may cause hypokalemia if they are used with Spironolactone. The blood pressure lowering and diuretic effects of Furosemide may be reduced or abolished when used together with indomethacin and possibly other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furosemide may increase the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Simultaneous administration of sucralfate and Furosemide may reduce the natriuretic and anti-hypertensive effect of Furosemide.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with anuria, acute renal insufficiency, rapidly deteriorating or severe impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), hyperkalaemia, Addison's disease and in patients who are hypersensitive to Spironolactone, Furosemide or sulphonamides.\rSide Effects\rSpironolactone may give rise to headache and drowsiness and gastrointestinal distress, including cramp and diarrhoea. Ataxia, mental confusion, and skin rashes have been reported as side effect. Gynaecomastia is not uncommon and in rare cases breast enlargement may persist. Other endocrine disorders including hirsutism, deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities and impotence. Transient increase in blood-urea-nitrogen concentrations may occur and mild acidosis has been reported. Spironolactone may cause hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Excessive diuresis may result in dehydration and reduction in blood volume with circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism particularly in elderly patients. Serious depletion of potassium and magnesium may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Spironolactone and its metabolites may cross the placental barrier. The use of spironolactone in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and fetus. Animal teratology studies indicate that Furosemide may cause fetal abnormalities. Therefore, Furosemide should only be used in women in child bearing age when appropriate contraceptive measures are taken or if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.\r Lactation: Metabolites of Spironolactone have been detected in breast milk. If use of Spironolactone is considered essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted.

Daily maintenance dose-\r12 month-2 years: 10-20 mg (10-20 ml)\r2 years-6 years: 20-30 mg (20-30 ml)\r6 years-10 years: 30-60 mg (30-60 ml)\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rIncreased sedation may occur if Lirosal is taken with agents acting on the central nervous system, alcohol or synthetic opiates. The risk of respiratory depression is also increased.\rCombined treatment with Lirosal and antihypertensives is likely to increase the fall in blood pressure; therefore the dosage of antihypertensive medication should be adjusted accordingly.\rThe concomitant administration of Lirosal and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the pharmacological effects of Lirosal resulting in pronounced muscular hypotonia.\rIn patients with Parkinsons disease receiving treatment with Lirosal and levodopa and carbidopa, there have been several reports of mental confusion, hallucinations, headaches, nausea and agitation.\rThe concurrent use of MAO inhibitors and Lirosal may result in increased CNS depressant effects. Caution is advised and the dosage of one or both agents should be adjusted accordingly.\rCaution should be exercised when administering Lirosal and magnesium sulphate or other neuromuscular blocking agents since a synergistic effect may theoretically occur.\rContraindications\rBaclofen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse reactions associated with Lirosal are transient drowsiness, daytime sedation, dizziness, weakness and fatigue.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache (<10%), insomnia (<10%), and rarely, euphoria, excitement, depression, confusion, hallucinations, paraesthesia, nightmares, muscle pain, tinnitus, slurred speech, co-ordination disorder, tremor, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, blurred vision, nystagmus, strabismus, miosis, mydriasis, diplopia, dysarthria, epileptic seizures, respiratory depression.\rCardiovascular: Hypotension (<10%), rare instances of dyspnoea, palpitation, chest pain, syncope.\rGastrointestinal: Nausea (approximately 10%), constipation (<10%) and rarely, dry mouth, anorexia, taste disorder, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and positive test for occult blood in stool.\rGenitourinary: Urinary frequency (<10%) and rarely, enuresis, urinary retention, dysuria, impotence, inability to ejaculate, nocturia, haematuria.\rOther: Instances of rash, pruritus, ankle oedema, excessive perspiration, weight gain, nasal congestion, visual disturbances, hepatic function disorders and paradoxical increase in spasticity. Muscular hypotonia of a degree sufficient to make walking or movement difficult may occur but is usually relieved by readjusting the dosage. For this purpose, the daytime dosage may be reduced and the evening dosage increased.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B3. Safe use of Baclofen during pregnancy has not been established. Baclofen crosses the placental barrier. Baclofen should only be administered to pregnant women when in the judgement of the physician concludes that the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk however evidence to date suggests that the quantities are so small that no undesirable effects on the infant would be expected.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLower doses (approximately 5 mg per day) should be used for patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing chronic haemodialysis.\rPatients suffering not only from spasticity but also from psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, depressive or manic disorders or confusional states should be treated cautiously and closely monitored as exacerbations of these disorders may occur.\rIn patients with epilepsy and muscle spasticity, Lirosal may be used under appropriate supervision and provided that adequate anticonvulsive therapy is continued. Lowering of the convulsion threshold may occur and seizures have been reported after the cessation of Lirosal therapy or with overdose.\rLirosal should be used with caution in patients with or with a history of peptic ulcers, cerebrovascular diseases, or hepatic, renal or respiratory failure.\rCareful monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is essential especially in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and respiratory muscle weakness.\rDuring treatment with Lirosal, neurogenic disturbances affecting emptying of the bladder may improve. However in patients with preexisting sphincter hypertonia, acute retention of urine may occur. Lirosal should be used with caution in these circumstances.\rLirosal has not significantly benefited patients with stroke. These patients have also shown poor tolerance to the medicine.\rAppropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically in patients with hepatic diseases or diabetes mellitus to ensure that no medicine induced changes in these underlying diseases have occurred.\rOverdose Effects\rGastric lavage is important in case of severe overdose.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nLirosal is indicated in-\r\nspasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis\r\nflexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus and muscular rigidity\r\nskeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders\r\nspinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases\r\ncerebrovascular accidents or neoplastic or degenerative brain disease\r\nPharmacology\r\nBaclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level by stimulating the GABAB receptors, which inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated:\rTo reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class ll-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.\rFor the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients aged one year and older.\rThis is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or other ARB.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. This tablet inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of this tablet in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult Heart Failure: The recommended starting dose is 49/51 mg orally twice daily. Double the dose after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.\r Reduce the starting dose to 24/26 mg twice daily for:\rPatients not currently taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or previously taking a low dose of these agents.\rPatients with severe renal impairment.\rPatients with moderate hepatic impairment.\rPediatric Heart Failure: Refer to Table 1 for the recommended dose for pediatric patients aged one year and older. Take the recommended dose orally twice daily.

In healthy volunteers, a single dose of this tablet 583 mg sacubitril/617 mg valsartan, and multiple doses of 437 mg sacubitril/463 mg valsartan (14 days) have been studied and were well tolerated. Hypotension is the most likely result of overdosage due to the blood-pressure-lowering effects of this tablet. Symptomatic treatment should be provided. This tablet is unlikely to be removed by hemodialysis because of high protein binding.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place and store below 30\u00b0C. Protect from moisture and keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated:\r\nTo reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class ll-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.\r\nFor the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients aged one year and older.\r\nThis is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or other ARB.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis tablet contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. This tablet inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of this tablet in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult Heart Failure: The recommended starting dose is 49/51 mg orally twice daily. Double the dose after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.\r\n \nReduce the starting dose to 24/26 mg twice daily for:\r\nPatients not currently taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or previously taking a low dose of these agents.\r\nPatients with severe renal impairment.\r\nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment.\r\nPediatric Heart Failure: Refer to Table 1 for the recommended dose for pediatric patients aged one year and older. Take the recommended dose orally twice daily. Adjust pediatric patient doses every 2 weeks, as tolerated by the patient.\r\n \nRecommended Dose Titration-\r\n \nPediatric Patients Less than 40 kg:\r\nStarting: 1.6 mg/kg\r\nSecond: 2.3 mg/kg\r\nFinal: 3.1 mg/kg\r\nPediatric Patients At least 40 kg, less than 50 kg:\r\nStarting: 24/26 mg\r\nSecond: 49/51 mg\r\nFinal: 49/51 mg\r\nPediatric Patients At least 50 kg:\r\nStarting: 49/51 mg\r\nSecond: 72/78 mg\r\nFinal: 97/103 mg\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nDual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System: Should not be used with an ACEi, aliskiren in patients with diabetes, and use with an ARB should be avoided.\r\nPotassium-sparing Diuretics: Serum potassium level may be increased.\r\nNSAIDs: Risk of renal impairment may be increased.\r\nLithium: Increased risk of lithium toxicity.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis combination is contraindicated:\r\nIn patients with hypersensitivity to any component\r\nIn patients with a history of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy \r\nWith concomitant use of ACE inhibitors.

The risk of myopathy during treatment with RoZenon may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. RoZenon therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. RoZenon therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required.

Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r\n \nVery High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r\n \nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)]. It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute Coronary Syndrome: In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel with a single 300 mg (4 tablets) oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiating it without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days.\r Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease: 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose.\r It is given orally with or without food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNSAIDs, warfarin, selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs): Increases risk of bleeding\rCYP2C19 inhibitors (omeprazole or esomeprazole): Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole\rRepaglinide (CYP2C8 substrates): Avoid concomitant use of Clognil with Repaglinide as it increases plasma concentrations of Repaglinide\rContraindications\rClopidogrel is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rClognil is generally well tolerated drug.\rCommon side effects: Bleeding, Diarrhoea, gastrointestinal discomfort, haemorrhage, Skin reactions.\rRare side effects: Acquired haemophilia, anaemia, angioedema, arthralgia, arthritis, bone marrow disorders.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs it is a prodrug, so metabolism to its active metabolite is impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 (poor metabolizer) and by the drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 such as Omeprazole and Esomeprazole. Concomitant use with these drugs and in CYP2C19 poor metaboliser may reduce the antiplatelet activity of Clognil.\rAs it inhibits platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), risk of bleeding may increase. To restore hemostasis, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\rDiscontinuation of Clognil increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume Clognil as soon as hemostasis is achieved.\rThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).\rHypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.\rUse in Special Populations\rSafety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been established. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature in a dry place. Protected from light. Do not freeze. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)].

        "description": "Indications\rRozavel is indicated for:\rPatients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, non HDL-C and TG levels and to increase HDL-C.\rPatients with hypertriglyceredemia as an adjunct to diet.\rPatients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct to diet.\r... Read more\rRosu - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\rDosage & Administration\rHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r Very High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r Dosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r Use with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRemarkable drug interactions of Rozavel are-\rCyclosporine: Combination increases Rozavel exposure. Rozavel dose should be limited to 5 mg once daily.\rGemfibrosil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, Rozavel dose should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\rLopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases Rozavel exposure. Rozavel dose should be to 10 mg once daily.\rCoumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs international normalized ratio (INR). Stable INR should be achieved prior to starting Rozavel. INR should be monitored frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of Rozavel therapy.\rConcomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates and niacin products may increase the risk of skeletal muscle effects.\rContraindications\rRosuvastatin is contraindicated if-\rKnown hypersensitivity to product components\rLiver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels\rPregnant women and women who may become pregnant\rNursing mothers\rSide Effects\rRozavel is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rozavel were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRozavel should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rozavel may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rozavel therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rozavel therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of Rozavel.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30oC temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r\n \nVery High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r\n \nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r\n \nDosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r\n \nUse with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r\n \nConcomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r\n \nDosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRemarkable drug interactions of Rozavel are-\r\nCyclosporine: Combination increases Rozavel exposure. Rozavel dose should be limited to 5 mg once daily.\r\nGemfibrosil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, Rozavel dose should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r\nLopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases Rozavel exposure. Rozavel dose should be to 10 mg once daily.\r\nCoumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs international normalized ratio (INR). Stable INR should be achieved prior to starting Rozavel. INR should be monitored frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of Rozavel therapy.\r\nConcomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates and niacin products may increase the risk of skeletal muscle effects.\r\nContraindications\r\nRosuvastatin is contraindicated if-\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to product components\r\nLiver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels\r\nPregnant women and women who may become pregnant\r\nNursing mothers\r\nSide Effects\r\nRozavel is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rozavel were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRozavel should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rozavel may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rozavel therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rozavel therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of Rozavel.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30oC temperature, protected from light & moisture.

The combination of Ezetimibe with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in serum transaminases.\r\nSide Effects\r\nClinical studies of Ezetrol (administered alone or with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) demonstrated that Ezetrol was generally well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with Ezetrol was similar to that reported with placebo, and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was also similar for Ezetrol and placebo.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Ezetimibe in pregnant women. Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nExclude or treat secondary causes of dyslipidaemia prior to initiating therapy. Renal and hepatic impairment. Pregnancy and lactation.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use-\r\n \n10 to 17 years: No dosage adjustment is required. The clinical experience in pediatric and adolescent patients is however limited. When Ezetrol is administered with statin, the dosage instructions for statin, in adolescents should be consulted.\r\n \nChildren < 10 years: Ezetrol is not recommended for use in children below age 10 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNo cases of overdosage with Ezetrol have been reported. Administration of Ezetrol,\r\n50 mg/day, to 15 subjects for up to 14 days was generally well tolerated. In the event of\r\nan overdose, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nEzetimibe\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place protected from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.\rPharmacology\rVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.\r Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Glucomin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, this combination may be initiated at twice daily, 1 tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. Taking this combination with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when Vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was co-administered with Metformin Hydrochloride (1,000 mg once daily). Vildagliptin has a low potential for drug interactions. Since Vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate nor does it inhibit nor induces CYP 450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with co-medications that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. As a result of these studies no clinically relevant interactions with other oral antidiabetics (glibenclamide, pioglitazone, metformin hydrochloride), amlodipine, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, valsartan or warfarin were observed after co-administration with vildagliptin. On the other hand, furosemide, nifedipine and glyburide increase Cmax and blood AUC of Metformin with no change in renal clearance of Metformin.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are headache, tremor, dizziness, nausea, hypoglycaemia etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women and therefore, this combination should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. No studies have been conducted with the components of this combination. As it is not known whether Vildagliptin and/or Metformin Hydrochloride is excreted in human milk this combination should not be administered to breast-feeding women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least once a year in patients with normal renal function and 2\u20134 times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of normal and in elderly patients. Special caution should be exercised in elderly patients where renal function may become impaired (e.g. when initiating antihypertensives, diuretics or NSAIDs). It is recommended that Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are monitored prior to initiation of Vildapin Plus, at three-monthly intervals in the first year and periodically thereafter. If transaminase levels are increased, patients should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality return to normal. If AST or ALT persist at 3 x ULN, Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be stopped Patients who develop jaundice or other signs of liver dysfunction. Following withdrawal of treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin and LFT normalization, treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin should not be reinitiated. Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of Vildapin Plus in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, Vildapin Plus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.\r Use in geriatric patients: As Metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal function, elderly patients taking Vildapin Plus should have their renal function monitored regularly. Vildapin Plus should only be used in elderly patients with normal renal function.\r Patients with renal impairment: Vildapin Plus should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dl (>135 micro mol/L) in males and > 1.4 mg/dl (>110 micro mol/L) in females.\r Patients with hepatic impairment: Vildapin Plus is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST >3 X the upper limit of normal.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombination Oral hypoglycemic preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nThis tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.\r\nPharmacology\r\nVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide).

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol & Amlodipine combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with the individual products given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination, but as separate tablets\rPharmacology\rThis consists of Amlodipine and Bisoprolol Fumarate. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet once daily in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with separately administered monocomponent products of the same doses as the recommended fixed-dose combination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCombinations not recommended: Calcium antagonists of the verapamil and diltiazem type, centrally-acting antihypertensive drugs.\r Combinations to be used with caution: Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, simvastatin, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, parasympathomimetic drugs, topical beta-blockers (e.g. eye drops), insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs, anesthetic agents, digitalis glycosides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sympathomimetic agents, antihypertensive agents and other drugs with blood pressure lowering potential.\r Combinations to be considered: Mefloquine, Rifampicin, Ergotamine derivatives, MAO inhibitors (except MAO-B inhibitor).\rContraindications\rAcute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation, obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis), cardiogenic shock, second or third degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, sinoatrial block, symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, severe bronchial asthma, severe forms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease or severe forms of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, untreated phaeochromocytoma metabolic acidosis, hypersensitivity to bisoprolol, amlodipine, dihydropyridine derivates or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Dizziness, headache, somnolence, palpitations, flushing, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain; edema (e.g. ankle edema), fatigue.\r Uncommon: Insomnia, mood changes (incl. anxiety), depression, sleep disorders, hypaesthesia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, tremor, visual disturbances (incl. diplopia), tinnitus, AV conduction disturbances, worsening of pre existing heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, dyspnea, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma or a history of obstructive airway disease, rhinitis, dyspepsia, dry mouth, alopecia, purpura, skin discoloration, pruritus, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle cramps, back pain, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakisuria, potency disorders, gynecomastia, asthenia, chest pain, pain, malaise, weight increase, weight decrease.\r Rare: Allergic reactions mainly affecting the skin, nightmares, hallucinations, confusion, decreased tear secretion, hearing disorders, allergic rhinitis, hepatitis, increased triglycerides, increased liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with heart failure should be treated with caution. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function cannot be excluded. Since the abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to a transitory worsening of the clinical condition, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, the treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Caution is advised in patients with impaired hepatic function. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with obstructive airways diseases unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Due to the bisoprolol component treatment must be used with caution in: bronchospasm (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease; concomitant bronchodilating therapy may be recommended); diabetes mellitus showing large fluctuations in blood glucose values, symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked; strict fasting; ongoing desensitization therapy; first degree AV block; Prinzmetal\u2019s angina; peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with psoriasis or with a history of psoriasis should only be given beta-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) after a careful balancing of benefits and risks. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the anesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw beta blocker therapy before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours before anesthesia.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric use: The usual doses can be administered to elderly people; however, caution is advised when the dose is increased.\r Pediatric use: The safety and efficacy of Bisoprolol fumarate/amlodipine in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available.\r Patients with Liver disease: In case of hepatic impairment elimination of amlodipine may be elongated. Exact dosage recommendations concerning amlodipine have not been established, but the drug should therefore be administered with special caution in these patients. In case of severe hepatic impairment, the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg.\r Patients with Kidney disease: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Amlodipine should be administered with particular caution to patients undergoing dialysis. In case of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg\rOverdose Effects\rMost common signs expected with overdose of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, acute cardiac insufficiency, hypoglycemia. According to available data gross overdose of amlodipine could result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. In general, if overdose occurs, discontinuation of treatment and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-hypertensive\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place, below 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rPladex-A is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPladex-A may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Pladex-A.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Pladex-A or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur.

        "description": "Indications\rOlsart is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olsart was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olsart is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olsart, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olsart and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olsart may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlsart has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olsart was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olsart and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olsart and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olsart and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olsart, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olsart (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olsart. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olsart.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olsart. The most likely effects of Olsart overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olsart requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betafix fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Betafix fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Betafix in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

        "description": "Indications\rDisys is indicated:\rFor hypertension\rTo reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\rTo reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\rPharmacology\rValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage\rHypertension: The usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs within 4 weeks. \r Heart failure: The usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily. \r Post-Myocardial Infarction: The initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if tolerated without side effects.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40%, so it should be taken on an empty stomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo drug interactions of clinical significance have been found. Compounds which have been studied in clinical trials include Cimetidine, Warfarin, Furosemide, Digoxin, Atenolol, Indomethacin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine and Glibenclamide\r As Disys is not metabolized to a significant extent, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in the form of metabolic induction or inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system are not expected with Disys. Although Disys is highly bound to plasma proteins, in vitrostudies have not shown any interaction at this level with a range of molecules which are also highly protein bound, such as Diclofenac, Furosemide, and Warfarin. Concomitant use of potassium sparing diuretics (e.g., Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride) potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. If co medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable\rContraindications\rValsartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rDisys is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Disys.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r Nursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Disys is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r Impaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of Disys was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some elderly persons cannot be ruled out.\r Hepatic Impairment:\rMild to moderate: Max: 80 mg once daily.\rSevere: Contraindicated.\rOverdose Effects\rLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore between 15-30\u00b0 C.

The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if tolerated without side effects.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40%, so it should be taken on an empty stomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo drug interactions of clinical significance have been found. Compounds which have been studied in clinical trials include Cimetidine, Warfarin, Furosemide, Digoxin, Atenolol, Indomethacin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine and Glibenclamide\r\n \nAs Disys is not metabolized to a significant extent, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in the form of metabolic induction or inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system are not expected with Disys. Although Disys is highly bound to plasma proteins, in vitrostudies have not shown any interaction at this level with a range of molecules which are also highly protein bound, such as Diclofenac, Furosemide, and Warfarin. Concomitant use of potassium sparing diuretics (e.g., Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride) potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. If co medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable\r\nContraindications\r\nValsartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDisys is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Disys.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Disys is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r\n \nImpaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r\n \nHeart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of Disys was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some elderly persons cannot be ruled out.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment:\r\nMild to moderate: Max: 80 mg once daily.\r\nSevere: Contraindicated.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore between 15-30\u00b0 C. Protect from moisture and heat.",

        "description": "Indications\rRovast is indicated for:\rPatients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, non HDL-C and TG levels and to increase HDL-C.\rPatients with hypertriglyceredemia as an adjunct to diet.\rPatients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct to diet.\rPatients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL-C, total-C, and ApoB.\rSlowing the progression of atherosclerosis as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C as an adjunct to diet.\rPediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C and ApoB after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy.\rRisk reduction of Myocardial Infarction (MI), stroke and arterial revascularization procedures in patients without clinically evident CHD, but with multiple risk factors.\rRosu - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\rDosage & Administration\rHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r Very High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r Dosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r Use with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRemarkable drug interactions of Rovast are-\rCyclosporine: Combination increases Rovast exposure. Rovast dose should be limited to 5 mg once daily.\rGemfibrosil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, Rovast dose should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\rLopinavir/Ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir: Combination increases Rovast exposure. Rovast dose should be to 10 mg once daily.\rCoumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs international normalized ratio (INR). Stable INR should be achieved prior to starting Rovast. INR should be monitored frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of Rovast therapy.\rConcomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates and niacin products may increase the risk of skeletal muscle effects.\rContraindications\rRosuvastatin is contraindicated if-\rKnown hypersensitivity to product components\rLiver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels\rPregnant women and women who may become pregnant\rNursing mothers\rSide Effects\rRovast is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rovast were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRovast should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rovast may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rovast therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rovast therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of Rovast.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30oC temperature, protected from light & moisture.

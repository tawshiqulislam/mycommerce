It is intended exclusively for topical application.\r VitiLSi Gel 15ml\rVitiLSi is a completely new, patented and innovative concept for the treatment of vitiligo. It is intended exclusively for topical application. VitiLSi is formulated on the basis of standardized herbal active ingredients. More precisely, this is a combination of two plant extracts \u2013 Coleus forskohlii (Indian nettle) and Cassia alata (Senna).\r These two active ingredients have been widely researched and are the subject of numerous scientific reports. In particular, their safety for topical use has been proven. It was tested by well-known dermatologists who primarily deal with the treatment of vitiligo in order to evaluate its effectiveness, as well as the absence of side effects when using it.\r VitiLSi very often leads to complete or almost complete regimentation in a relatively short period of time (several weeks) compared to the average time of the physiological process of melanogenesis.\r How to get the best results?\rVitiLSi must be applied to depigmentation once a day, preferably in the morning, on previously cleansed and dry skin. Application should be careful and only on depigmented skin. Application to the edges or parts of the skin that are normally pigmented will cause the skin to darken, as if it were sunburned.\r The effectiveness of VitiLSi is further increased by short-term, daily exposure to solar radiation at a time when solar radiation is safe, for example 10 minutes every 10 hours. The time interval between application of VitiLSi gel and sun exposure is not important.\r In case of cloudy weather or absence of sun, simple exposure to visible light may also be beneficial. An even more effective dermatological solution is the use of VitiLSi gel in combination with phototherapy (NB), under strict supervision.\r Once the repigmentation is judged to be satisfactory, applications of VitiLSi gel may be thinned out or discontinued, but the acquired pigmentation will likely disappear over time. In that case, it is recommended to start daily applications of VitiLSi gel again.\r The first results are visible already after 14 days, and the full effect is achieved after 3 months of daily use.\rCorrective make-up can be applied over VitiLSi gel.\r Additional recommendation: VitiLSi gel can be combined with other types of treatment or therapy for vitiligo.\r\nVitiLSi is a completely new, patented and innovative concept for the treatment of vitiligo.

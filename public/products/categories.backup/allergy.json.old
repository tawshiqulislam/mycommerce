Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFexo does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexo with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexo caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexo and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexo should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexo tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexo has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexo. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexo has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexo from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rProvair has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair. No dosage adjustment for Provair is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Provair.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rProvair is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Provair can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Provair should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Provair should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Provair. Although Provair is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Provair and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFexo does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexo with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexo caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexo and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexo should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexo tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexo has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexo. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexo has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexo from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAllergic Rhinitis-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\r\nSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years:\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r\n \n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nFexo does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexo with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexo caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexo and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r\n \nThere are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexo should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexo tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexo has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r\n \nElderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexo. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexo has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexo from blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r\n \nElderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenadin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenadin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenadin from blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

This applies specially to systemic corticosteroids and ACTH because of the possible existence of adrenocortical insufficiency in steroid dependent patient. If inter current infection occurs, Tofen treatment must be supplemented by specific antimicrobial therapy. During the first day of treatment with Tofen, reactions may be impaired and patients should be warned not to take charge of vehicle or machinery until the effect of Tofen treatment on the individual is known. Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic drinks. Tofen may potentiate the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines and alcohol.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe reported features of overdosage include confusion, drowsiness, headache, bradycardia, respiratory depression etc. should be watched for. Elimination of the drug with gastric lavage or emessis is recommended. Otherwise, general supportive treatment is all that is required shall be instituted.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCromoglycate & related drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protect from light.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFenadin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fenadin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fenadin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fenadin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fenadin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fenadin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fenadin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenadin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenadin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenadin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r\n \nThere are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fenadin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fenadin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fenadin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r\n \nElderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenadin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenadin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenadin from blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC32H39NO4\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Fexofenadine Hydrochloride\r\nCommon Questions about Fenadin 30 mg/5 ml Suspension\r\nWhat is Fenadin 30 mg/5 ml Suspension?\r\nFenadin 30 mg/5 ml Suspension is an antihistamine.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken.

But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Biltin shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Biltin 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Biltin 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Biltin after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Biltin is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Biltin. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Biltin in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Biltin should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Biltin at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo.

It also has the properties of an antihistamine. Ketotifen possesses marked anti-anaphylactic properties and is effective in preventing an asthmatic attacks. Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 1 mg twice daily with food. If necessary the dose may be increased to 2 mg twice daily in severe cases.\r Children above 3 years: 1 mg twice daily with food.

A reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Tifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agents and it has been suggested that Tofen should therefore be avoided.\rContraindications\rA reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Ketotifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agent and it has been suggested that this combination should therefore be avoided. Although there is no evidence of any teratogenic effect, recommendations for Ketotifen in pregnancy or when breast feeding can not be given.\rSide Effects\rDrowsiness and in isolated cases, dry mouth and slight dizziness may occur at the beginning of treatment but usually disappear spontaneously after a few days.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough there is no evidence of any teratogenic effect, Ketotifen in pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIt is important to continue the previous treatment for a minimum of two weeks after starting Tofen to avoid the possibility of exacerbation of asthma. This applies specially to systemic corticosteroids and ACTH because of the possible existence of adrenocortical insufficiency in steroid dependent patient. If inter current infection occurs, Tofen treatment must be supplemented by specific antimicrobial therapy. During the first day of treatment with Tofen, reactions may be impaired and patients should be warned not to take charge of vehicle or machinery until the effect of Tofen treatment on the individual is known. Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic drinks. Tofen may potentiate the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines and alcohol.\rOverdose Effects\rThe reported features of overdosage include confusion, drowsiness, headache, bradycardia, respiratory depression etc. should be watched for.

It also has the properties of an antihistamine. Ketotifen possesses marked anti-anaphylactic properties and is effective in preventing an asthmatic attacks. Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults: 1 mg twice daily with food. If necessary the dose may be increased to 2 mg twice daily in severe cases.\r\n \nChildren above 3 years: 1 mg twice daily with food. Patients known to be easily sedated should begin treatment with 0.5 to 1 mg at night for the first few days or as directed by the physician.\r\n \nUse in elderly: Same as adult dose or as advised by the physician.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nTofen may potentiate the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines and alcohols. A reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Tifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agents and it has been suggested that Tofen should therefore be avoided.\r\nContraindications\r\nA reversible fall in the platelet count has been observed in a few patients receiving Ketotifen concomitantly with oral antidiabetic agent and it has been suggested that this combination should therefore be avoided. Although there is no evidence of any teratogenic effect, recommendations for Ketotifen in pregnancy or when breast feeding can not be given.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDrowsiness and in isolated cases, dry mouth and slight dizziness may occur at the beginning of treatment but usually disappear spontaneously after a few days.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAlthough there is no evidence of any teratogenic effect, Ketotifen in pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIt is important to continue the previous treatment for a minimum of two weeks after starting Tofen to avoid the possibility of exacerbation of asthma. This applies specially to systemic corticosteroids and ACTH because of the possible existence of adrenocortical insufficiency in steroid dependent patient. If inter current infection occurs, Tofen treatment must be supplemented by specific antimicrobial therapy. During the first day of treatment with Tofen, reactions may be impaired and patients should be warned not to take charge of vehicle or machinery until the effect of Tofen treatment on the individual is known. Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic drinks. Tofen may potentiate the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines and alcohol.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe reported features of overdosage include confusion, drowsiness, headache, bradycardia, respiratory depression etc. should be watched for. Elimination of the drug with gastric lavage or emessis is recommended. Otherwise, general supportive treatment is all that is required shall be instituted.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCromoglycate & related drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protect from light.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rProvair has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair. No dosage adjustment for Provair is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Provair.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rProvair is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Provair can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Provair should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Provair should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Provair. Although Provair is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Provair and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nProvair ODT has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair ODT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair ODT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair ODT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair ODT. No dosage adjustment for Provair ODT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Provair ODT.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nProvair ODT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Provair ODT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Provair ODT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Provair ODT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Provair ODT. Although Provair ODT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Provair ODT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

It has greater anti-inflammatory potency than Prednisolone, even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. The relative potency of Predixa to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\rprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r Pharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r Multiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r Methylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\rDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\rAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\rBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\rAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\rIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Predixa. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Predixa. while Predixa reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Predixa may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Predixa may need to be lowered.\rContraindications\rSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\rSide Effects\rShort courses of Predixa are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Predixa should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Predixa and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Predixa can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Predixa in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Predixa usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Predixa not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, away from light.

It has greater anti-inflammatory potency than Prednisolone, even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. The relative potency of Predixa to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\rprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r Pharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r Multiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r Methylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\rDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\rAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\rBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\rAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\rIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Predixa. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Predixa. while Predixa reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Predixa may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Predixa may need to be lowered.\rContraindications\rSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\rSide Effects\rShort courses of Predixa are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Predixa should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Predixa and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Predixa can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Predixa in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Predixa usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Predixa not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, away from light.

The relative potency of Predixa to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\r\nprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r\n \nPharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r\n \nAs anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r\n \nAs anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r\n \nMultiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r\n \nMethylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\r\nDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\r\nDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\r\nDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\r\nAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r\n \nThe following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\r\nBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\r\nAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\r\nIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Predixa. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Predixa. while Predixa reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Predixa may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Predixa may need to be lowered.\r\nContraindications\r\nSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nShort courses of Predixa are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Predixa should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Predixa and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Predixa can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Predixa in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Predixa usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Predixa not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nGlucocorticoids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, away from light. Keep out of reach of children.\r\n",

Besides Deflazacort decreases the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system. By decreasing the release of these chemicals Deflazacort provides immunosuppressive action.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults-\rFor acute disorders: Up to 120 mg/day Deflazacort may need to be given initially. Maintenance doses in most conditions are within the range of 3-18 mg/day.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The maintenance dose is usually within the range of 3-18 mg/day. The smallest effective dose should be used and increased if necessary.\rBronchial asthma: In the treatment of an acute attack, high doses of 48-72 mg/day may be needed depending on severity and gradually reduced once the attack has been controlled. For maintenance in chronic asthma, doses should be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms.\rOther conditions: The dose of Deflazacort depends on clinical need titrated to the lowest effective dose for maintenance. Starting doses may be estimated on the basis of ratio of 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone to 6 mg.\rChildren: There has been limited exposure of children to Deflazacort in clinical trials. In children, the indications for glucocorticoids arethe same as for adults, but it is important that the lowest effective dosage is used. Alternate day administration may be appropriate. Doses of Deflazacort usually lie in the range 0.25-1.5 mg/kg/day.\r The following ranges provide general guidance:\rJuvenile chronic arthritis: The usual maintenance dose is between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day.\rNephrotic syndrome: Initial dose of usually 1.5 mg/kg/day followed by down titration according to clinical need.\rBronchial asthma: On the basis of the potency ratio, the initial dose should be between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg on alternate days.\rDeflazacort withdrawal: In patients who have received more than physiological doses of systemic corticosteroids (approximately 9 mg per day or equivalent) for greater than 3 weeks, withdrawal should not be abrupt. How dose reduction should be carried out depends largely on whether the disease is likely to relapse as the dose of systemic corticosteroids is reduced.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDeflaza is metabolized in the liver. It is recommended to increase the maintenance dose of Deflaza if drugs which are liver enzyme inducers are co-administered, e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone and aminoglutethimide. For drugs which inhibit liver enzymes, (e.g. ketoconazole) it may be possible to reduce the maintenance dose of Deflaza.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to or any of the ingredients. Patients receiving live virus immunization.\rSide Effects\rGI disturbances, musculoskeletal, endocrine, neuropsychiatric, ophthalmic, fluid and electrolyte disturbances; susceptible to infection, impaired healing, hypersensitivity, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, acne, myocardial rupture following recent Ml, thromboembolism.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Deflazacort does cross the placenta. However, when administered for prolonged periods or repeatedly during pregnancy, corticosteroids may increase the risk of intrauterine growth retardation. As with all drugs, corticosteroids should only be prescribed when the benefits to the mother and child outweigh the risks.\r Nursing Mother: Corticosteroids are excreted in breast milk, although no data are available for Deflazacort. Doses of up to 50 mg daily of Deflazacort are unlikely to cause systemic effects in the infant. Infants of mothers taking higher doses than this may have a degree of adrenal suppression but the benefits of breastfeeding are likely to outweigh any theoretical risk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe following clinical conditions require special caution and frequent patient monitoring is necessary-\rCardiac disease or congestive heart failure (except in the presence of active rheumatic carditis), hypertension, thromboembolic disorders. Glucocorticoids can cause salt and water retention and increased excretion of potassium. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary.\rGastritis or oesophagitis, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis if there is the probability of impending perforation, abscess or pyogenic infections, fresh intestinal anastomosis, active or latent peptic ulcer.\rDiabetes mellitus or family history, osteoporosis, myasthenia gravis, renal insufficiency.\rEmotional instability or psychotic tendency, epilepsy.\rPrevious corticosteroid-induced myopathy.\rLiver failure.\rHypothyroidism and cirrhosis, which may increase the glucocorticoid effect.\rOcular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment, blood levels of may be increased. Therefore the dose of Deflaza should be carefully monitored and adjusted to the minimum effective dose.\r Renal Impairment: In renally impaired patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy are necessary.\r Elderly: In elderly patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy are necessary. The common adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids may be associated with more serious consequences in old age.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool (below 25\u00b0C) and dry place, protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rAllergic rhinitis: Afexa is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 12 years of age and over. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAfexa does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Afexa with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Afexa caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Afexa and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Afexa should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Afexa tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Afexa has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Afexa. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Afexa has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Afexa from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rRupatrol is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Seasonal & Perennial Allergic Rhinitis and Urticaria.\rMontica - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRupatadine is a long-acting, non-sedative antagonist of histamine H1-receptors. It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day. Rupatadine may be taken with or without food.\r Children aged 2 to 11 years:\rChildren weighing 25 kg or more: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) of the oral solution once daily with or without food.\rChildren weighing equal or more than 10 kg to less than 25 kg: 1/2 teaspoonful (2.5 ml) oral solution once daily with or without food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWith medicine: The concomitant administration of Rupatrol 20 mg and ketoconazole or erythromycin increases the systemic exposure. Rupatrol should be used with caution when it is administered concomitantly with these drug substances and other inhibitors of the isozyme CYP3A4. Rupatrol should be used with caution when it is co-administered with statins, CNS depressants or alcohol.\r With food: Grapefruit and Grapefruit juice should not be taken simultaneously with Rupatadine\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to Rupatadine or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness. Uncommon: Appetite increased, arthralgia, back pain, concentration impaired, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dry throat, epistaxis, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, increased risk of infection, irritability, malaise, myalgia, nasal dryness, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, rash, thirst, vomiting, weight increased. Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no clinical data available on the exposure of Rupatadine during pregnancy. Pregnant women should therefore not use Rupatadine unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the infant. No information is available, whether Rupatadine is excreted in the mother's milk.

Vitis vinifera is the principal herb of Revatol belongs to Vitaceae family is a perennial woody vine native to Asia and then introduced in Europe and other continents. It is familiar as grapes or Drakkha in Bangladesh.\r Chemical constituents: The chemical analysis has shown the presence of proanthocyanidins (PCOs) including procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavanoids. 3-oxo-a-ionol, vomifoliol and dehydrovomifoliol were identified for the first time in fruit from Vitis vinifera. Therapeutically active constituent, resveratrol is isolated from the skin of Grapes.\rPharmacology\rGrapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called \"proanthocyanidins\" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase.\r Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes.\r Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)\rDosage & Administration\rMahadrakkharist content of grapes is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montene did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montene was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montene approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montene. No dosage adjustment for Montene is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montene.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontene is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montene can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montene should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montene should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montene. Although Montene is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montene and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

It has greater anti-inflammatory potency than Prednisolone, even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. The relative potency of Methigic to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\rprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r Pharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r Multiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r Methylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\rDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\rAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\rBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\rAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\rIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Methigic. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Methigic. while Methigic reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Methigic may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Methigic may need to be lowered.\rContraindications\rSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\rSide Effects\rShort courses of Methigic are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Methigic should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Methigic and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Methigic can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Methigic in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Methigic usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Methigic not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, away from light.

The relative potency of Methigic to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\r\nprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r\n \nPharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r\n \nAs anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r\n \nAs anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r\n \nMultiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r\n \nMethylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\r\nDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\r\nDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\r\nDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\r\nDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\r\nAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r\n \nThe following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\r\nBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\r\nAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\r\nIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Methigic. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Methigic. while Methigic reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Methigic may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Methigic may need to be lowered.\r\nContraindications\r\nSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nShort courses of Methigic are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Methigic should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Methigic and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Methigic can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Methigic in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Methigic usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Methigic not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nGlucocorticoids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, away from light. Keep out of reach of children.",

In children over 2 years Loratin tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic skin conditions such as urticaria, nettlerash.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet is a preparation of Loratadine. Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine Hr receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral Hi-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anticholinergic effect. It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and children over 12 years of age: One Loratadine tablet once daily. It is usually administered in the morning or when symptoms require treatment.\r Children 2-12 years: Body weight over 30 kg: one Loratadine tablet once daily, below 30 kg: half Loratadine tablet once daily.\r Below 2 years of age: Loratadine tablet is not recommended for use below 2 years of age since safety and efficacy has not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere are no reports of potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs. In contrast to many other histamine H1 receptor antagonists, Loratin has no potentiating effects when administered concurrently with alcohol, as measured by psychomotor performance studies. Concomitant therapy with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 may elevate plasma concentrations of either drug and this mayifesult in adverse effects. Cimetidine inhibits both enzymes while erythromycin or ketoconazole inhibits P450 3A4. These drugs increase Loratin serum concentrations but no adverse effects are reported.\rContraindications\rLoratadine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to their components.\rSide Effects\rDuring controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Loratin was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Loratin on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no experience of the use of Loratadine in human pregnancy. Therefore its use during pregnancy is not advisable. Loratadine is excreted in breast milk in a very small amount. So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\rOverdose Effects\rIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg.

It is also indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergen induced asthma.\rPharmacology\rCetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.\r Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Odmon did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Odmon was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Odmon approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Odmon. No dosage adjustment for Odmon is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Odmon.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOdmon is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Odmon can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Odmon should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Odmon should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Odmon. Although Odmon is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Odmon and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFenadin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fenadin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fenadin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fenadin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fenadin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fenadin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fenadin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenadin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenadin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenadin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC32H39NO4\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Fexofenadine Hydrochloride\rCommon Questions about Fenadin 180 mg Tablet\rWhat is Fenadin 180 mg Tablet?\rFenadin 180 mg Tablet is an antihistamine.

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAllergic Rhinitis-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\r\nSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years:\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r\n \n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nFenadin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fenadin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fenadin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fenadin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montekast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montekast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montekast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montekast. No dosage adjustment for Montekast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montekast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontekast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montekast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montekast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montekast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montekast. Although Montekast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montekast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nTrilock is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Trilock can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Trilock should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Trilock should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Trilock. Although Trilock is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Trilock and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rRufast is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Seasonal & Perennial Allergic Rhinitis and Urticaria.\rMontica - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rRupatadine is a long-acting, non-sedative antagonist of histamine H1-receptors. It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day. Rupatadine may be taken with or without food.\r Children aged 2 to 11 years:\rChildren weighing 25 kg or more: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) of the oral solution once daily with or without food.\rChildren weighing equal or more than 10 kg to less than 25 kg: 1/2 teaspoonful (2.5 ml) oral solution once daily with or without food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWith medicine: The concomitant administration of Rufast 20 mg and ketoconazole or erythromycin increases the systemic exposure. Rufast should be used with caution when it is administered concomitantly with these drug substances and other inhibitors of the isozyme CYP3A4. Rufast should be used with caution when it is co-administered with statins, CNS depressants or alcohol.\r With food: Grapefruit and Grapefruit juice should not be taken simultaneously with Rupatadine\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to Rupatadine or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness.

Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no clinical data available on the exposure of Rupatadine during pregnancy. Pregnant women should therefore not use Rupatadine unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the infant. No information is available, whether Rupatadine is excreted in the mother's milk. Therefore, it should not be used during lactation, unless the potential benefits for the mother justify the potential risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRufast should be used with caution in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, and patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia.

        "description": "Indications\rLora tablet provides fast, effective relief from the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis and skin allergies including chronic urticaria. It is also effective in alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, nasal discharge, itching, ocular itching and burning. Nasal and ocular sign and symptoms are relieved rapidly after oral administration. Lora tablet is also indicated in idiopathic urticaria. In children over 2 years Lora tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic skin conditions such as urticaria, nettlerash.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet is a preparation of Loratadine. Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine Hr receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral Hi-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anticholinergic effect. It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and children over 12 years of age: One Loratadine tablet once daily. It is usually administered in the morning or when symptoms require treatment.\r Children 2-12 years: Body weight over 30 kg: one Loratadine tablet once daily, below 30 kg: half Loratadine tablet once daily.\r Below 2 years of age: Loratadine tablet is not recommended for use below 2 years of age since safety and efficacy has not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere are no reports of potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs. In contrast to many other histamine H1 receptor antagonists, Lora has no potentiating effects when administered concurrently with alcohol, as measured by psychomotor performance studies. Concomitant therapy with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 may elevate plasma concentrations of either drug and this mayifesult in adverse effects. Cimetidine inhibits both enzymes while erythromycin or ketoconazole inhibits P450 3A4. These drugs increase Lora serum concentrations but no adverse effects are reported.\rContraindications\rLoratadine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to their components.\rSide Effects\rDuring controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Lora was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Lora on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no experience of the use of Loratadine in human pregnancy. Therefore its use during pregnancy is not advisable. Loratadine is excreted in breast milk in a very small amount. So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\rOverdose Effects\rIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg. Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children with overdoses of greater than 10 mg. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary. It would seem reasonable to treat patients presenting early after large overdoses with oral activated charcoal.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFixal does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fixal with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fixal caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fixal and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fixal should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fixal tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fixal has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fixal. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fixal has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fixal from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ...

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAllergic Rhinitis-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\r\nSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years:\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r\n \n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nFixal does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fixal with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fixal caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fixal and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r\n \nThere are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fixal should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fixal tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fixal has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r\n \nElderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fixal. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fixal has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fixal from blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montiva did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montiva was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montiva approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montiva. No dosage adjustment for Montiva is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montiva.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontiva is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montiva can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montiva should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montiva should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montiva. Although Montiva is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montiva and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nMontiva has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montiva did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montiva was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montiva approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montiva. No dosage adjustment for Montiva is recommended.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r Children between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r Children between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant use of Bilfast with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Bilfast. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Bilfast shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Bilfast 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Bilfast 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Bilfast after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Bilfast is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Bilfast. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Bilfast in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Bilfast should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Bilfast at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were dizziness, headache and nausea.

The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rHydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.

Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Roxyzin is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Roxyzin with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\rContraindications\rHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rSide effects reported with the administration of Roxyzin Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rClinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, Hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe potentiating action of Roxyzin must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with Roxyzin, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of Roxyzin, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Roxyzin. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment patient: In case of renal impairment, half of the normal dose should be given.\r Use in the elderly patient: In the elderly, it is advised to start with half the recommended dose due to the prolonged action.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most common manifestation of Roxyzin overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\r If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and Levarterenol or Metaraminol. Epinephrine should not be used as Roxyzin counteracts its pressor action.\r There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with Roxyzin. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. There is no practical method to quantitate Roxyzin in body fluids or tissue after its ingestion or administration.\rTherapeutic Class\rSedating Anti-histamine\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place.

Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension-\rAdults: 50-100 mg 4 times daily.\rChildren (>6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rPruritus due to allergic conditions-\rAdults: 25 mg 3 to 4 times daily.\rChildren ( 6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rAs a sedative (premedication and following general anesthesia)-\rAdults: 50-100 mg.\rChildren: 0.6 mg/kg of body weight.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRoxyzin may potentiate Meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Roxyzin is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Roxyzin with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\rContraindications\rHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rSide effects reported with the administration of Roxyzin Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rClinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, Hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe potentiating action of Roxyzin must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with Roxyzin, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of Roxyzin, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Roxyzin. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment patient: In case of renal impairment, half of the normal dose should be given.\r Use in the elderly patient: In the elderly, it is advised to start with half the recommended dose due to the prolonged action.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most common manifestation of Roxyzin overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\r If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and Levarterenol or Metaraminol. Epinephrine should not be used as Roxyzin counteracts its pressor action.\r There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with Roxyzin. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. There is no practical method to quantitate Roxyzin in body fluids or tissue after its ingestion or administration.\rTherapeutic Class\rSedating Anti-histamine\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place. Protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nRoxyzin Hydrochloride is indicated-\r\nFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.\r\nManagement of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus.\r\nAs a sedative when used as premedication and following general anesthesia.\r\nThe effectiveness of Roxyzin as an antianxiety agent for long-term use (>4 months) has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies.

It has greater anti-inflammatory potency than Prednisolone, even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention. The relative potency of Methsolon to Hydrocortisone is at least four to one.\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamic properties: Methylprednisolone Is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with the capacity to profoundly inhibit the immune system. Glucocorticoids primarily bind to and activate intracellular glucocorticoid receptors that being activated bind to promoter regions of DMA (which may activate or suppress transcription) and activate transcription factors that result in inactivation of genes through deacetylation of histones. Methylprednisolone influences the kidney and fluid & electrolyte balance, lipid,\rprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism, skeletal muscle, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\r Pharmacokinetic properties: The absolute bioavailability of Methylprednisclone is generally high (82% to 89%) following oral administration and rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is achieved around 1.5 to 2.3 hours across doses following oral administration in normal healthy adults. Methylprednisolone is widely distributed into the tissues and its volume of distribution is 41-61.5 liter. It crosses the Wood-brain barrier and the placental barrier and is secreted in breast milk. The plasma protein binding of Methylprednisolone in humans is approximately 77%. Methylprednisolone is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. No dosing adjustments are necessary for renal failure. Methylprednisolone is haemodializable.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual range is 2-48 mg daily in divided doses, depending on the specific disease being treated. \r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive initial dosage: As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive, the initial dosage of Methylprednisolone tablets may vary from 4-48 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated, in situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory dirtied response, Methylprednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be Individualized on the basis of the disease under treatment and the response of the patient.\r As anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive maintenance dosage: After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\r Multiple Sclerosis: In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of Methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\r Methylprednisolone 4 mg tablet can be used to treat and to control severe allergy end dermatitis following the guideline listed below to minimize the steroid withdrawal syndromes:\rDay 1: 2 tablets before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 2: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 2 tablets at bedtime\rDay 3: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet after dinner + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 4: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet after lunch + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 5: 1 tablet before breakfast + 1 tablet at bedtime\rDay 6: 1 tablet before breakfast\rAlternate-day therapy (ADT): Alternate-day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids, white minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, Cushingoid stats, Corficoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children.\r The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate-day therapy:\rBasic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should be applied.\rAlternate-day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for pefienis in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.\rIn less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate-day therapy. More severe disease state usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initiai control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rErythromycin, Clarithromycin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Rifampin and Ketoconazole inhibit the metabolism of Methsolon. Estrogens, including With control pills, can increase the effect of corticosteroids by 50%. Cyclosporin reduces the metabolism of Methsolon. while Methsolon reduces the metabolism of Cyclosporin. Methsolon may increase or decrease the effect of blood thinners (e.g. Warfarin). For all these Interactions, the dose of Methsolon may need to be lowered.\rContraindications\rSystemic fungal infections arid known hypersensitivity to components.\rSide Effects\rShort courses of Methsolon are usually well-tolerated with few, mild side effects. Long term, high doses of Methyiprednisoione may produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Whenever possible, the lowest effective doses of Methsolon should be used for the shortest length of time to minimize side effects. Alternate day dosing also can help reduce side effects. Side effects of Methsolon and other corticosteroids range from mild annoyances to serious irreversible bodily damage. Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, hair growth on the face, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances including depression, euphoria, insomnia etc. Prolonged use of Methsolon can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids. Abruptly stopping Methsolon in these individuals can cause symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and even shock. Therefore, withdrawal of Methsolon usually is accomplished by gradually lowering the dose. Gradually tapering Methsolon not only minimizes the symptoms of corticosteroid insufficiency, it also reduces the risk of an abrupt flare of the disease being treated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Dregs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk te the foetus. Mefhyiprednisofone has not been adequately evaluated in nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAdrenocortical insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rReport of acute toxicity and/or death following an overdose of glucocorticoid ere rare. No specific antidote is available; treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Serum electrolytes should be monitored.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, away from light.

Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFenofex does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fenofex with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fenofex caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fenofex and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fenofex should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fenofex tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fenofex has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenofex. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenofex has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenofex from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects.

        "description": "Indications\rAllergic rhinitis: Vifas is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 12 years of age and over. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat. Vifas improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity. \r Chronic idiopathic urticaria: Vifas is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Vifas significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, the number of wheals, and pruritus. Vifas improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rVifas does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Vifas with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Vifas caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Vifas and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Vifas should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Vifas tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Vifas has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Vifas. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Vifas has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Vifas from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rAllergic rhinitis: Vifas is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 12 years of age and over. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat. Vifas improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity. \r Chronic idiopathic urticaria: Vifas is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Vifas significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, the number of wheals, and pruritus. Vifas improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rVifas does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Vifas with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Vifas caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Vifas and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Vifas should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Vifas tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Vifas has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Vifas. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Vifas has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Vifas from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day.

Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no clinical data available on the exposure of Rupatadine during pregnancy. Pregnant women should therefore not use Rupatadine unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the infant. No information is available, whether Rupatadine is excreted in the mother's milk.

        "description": "Indications\rOradin tablet provides fast, effective relief from the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis and skin allergies including chronic urticaria. It is also effective in alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, nasal discharge, itching, ocular itching and burning. Nasal and ocular sign and symptoms are relieved rapidly after oral administration. Oradin tablet is also indicated in idiopathic urticaria. In children over 2 years Oradin tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic skin conditions such as urticaria, nettlerash.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet is a preparation of Loratadine. Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine Hr receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral Hi-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anticholinergic effect. It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and children over 12 years of age: One Loratadine tablet once daily. It is usually administered in the morning or when symptoms require treatment.\r Children 2-12 years: Body weight over 30 kg: one Loratadine tablet once daily, below 30 kg: half Loratadine tablet once daily.\r Below 2 years of age: Loratadine tablet is not recommended for use below 2 years of age since safety and efficacy has not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere are no reports of potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs. In contrast to many other histamine H1 receptor antagonists, Oradin has no potentiating effects when administered concurrently with alcohol, as measured by psychomotor performance studies. Concomitant therapy with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 may elevate plasma concentrations of either drug and this mayifesult in adverse effects. Cimetidine inhibits both enzymes while erythromycin or ketoconazole inhibits P450 3A4. These drugs increase Oradin serum concentrations but no adverse effects are reported.\rContraindications\rLoratadine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to their components.\rSide Effects\rDuring controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Oradin was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Oradin on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no experience of the use of Loratadine in human pregnancy. Therefore its use during pregnancy is not advisable. Loratadine is excreted in breast milk in a very small amount. So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\rOverdose Effects\rIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg. Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children with overdoses of greater than 10 mg. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary. It would seem reasonable to treat patients presenting early after large overdoses with oral activated charcoal.

It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and children over 12 years of age: One Loratadine tablet once daily. It is usually administered in the morning or when symptoms require treatment.\r Children 2-12 years: Body weight over 30 kg: one Loratadine tablet once daily, below 30 kg: half Loratadine tablet once daily.\r Below 2 years of age: Loratadine tablet is not recommended for use below 2 years of age since safety and efficacy has not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThere are no reports of potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs. In contrast to many other histamine H1 receptor antagonists, Oradin has no potentiating effects when administered concurrently with alcohol, as measured by psychomotor performance studies. Concomitant therapy with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 may elevate plasma concentrations of either drug and this mayifesult in adverse effects. Cimetidine inhibits both enzymes while erythromycin or ketoconazole inhibits P450 3A4. These drugs increase Oradin serum concentrations but no adverse effects are reported.\rContraindications\rLoratadine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to their components.\rSide Effects\rDuring controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Oradin was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Oradin on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no experience of the use of Loratadine in human pregnancy. Therefore its use during pregnancy is not advisable. Loratadine is excreted in breast milk in a very small amount. So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\rOverdose Effects\rIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg. Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children with overdoses of greater than 10 mg. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary. It would seem reasonable to treat patients presenting early after large overdoses with oral activated charcoal. The conscious patients may be induced to vomit or gastric lavage may be performed.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nOradin tablet provides fast, effective relief from the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis and skin allergies including chronic urticaria. It is also effective in alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, nasal discharge, itching, ocular itching and burning. Nasal and ocular sign and symptoms are relieved rapidly after oral administration. Oradin tablet is also indicated in idiopathic urticaria. In children over 2 years Oradin tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic skin conditions such as urticaria, nettlerash.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis tablet is a preparation of Loratadine.

But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Mylastin shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Mylastin 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Mylastin 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Mylastin after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Mylastin is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Mylastin. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Mylastin in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Mylastin should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Mylastin at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo.

Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAxodin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Axodin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Axodin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Axodin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Axodin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Axodin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Axodin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Axodin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Axodin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Axodin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAxodin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Axodin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Axodin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Axodin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Axodin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Axodin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Axodin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Axodin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Axodin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended.

        "description": "Indications\rAllergic rhinitis: Axodin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 12 years of age and over. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat. Axodin improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity. \r Chronic idiopathic urticaria: Axodin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Axodin significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, the number of wheals, and pruritus. Axodin improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAxodin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Axodin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Axodin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Axodin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Axodin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Axodin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Axodin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Axodin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Axodin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Axodin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rAtrizin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal & perennial allergic rhinitis. It is also indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergen induced asthma.\rPharmacology\rCetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.\r Pharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate. Peak blood levels 0.3 micrograms/ml are reached between thirty & sixty minutes after administration of 10 mg dose of Cetirizine. Its plasma half-life is approximately 11 hours. Absorption is very consistent from one subject to the next. Its renal clearance is 30 ml/minute and the excretion half-life is approximately nine hours.\rDosage & Administration\rCetirizine oral dosage form:\rAdults and Children 6 years and older: 1 tablet or 2 teaspoonfuls daily (or 1 teaspoonful twice daily).\rChildren 2-6 years: 1 teaspoonful once daily or 1/2 teaspoonful twice daily.\rChildren 6 months to 2 years : 1/2 teaspoonful once daily.

So, caution should be exercised when Cetirizine Hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be exercised when driving a car or operating a heavy machinery.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic or renal insufficiency: In patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment, total body clearance of Atrizin is reduced and AUC and half-life increased by about 2 to 3 fold. Clearance is reduced in proportion to the decline in creatinine clearance. Plasma levels are unaffected by hemodialysis. The plasma elimination half-life in dialysis patients is approximately 20 hours and the plasma AUC is increased by about threefold.\r Pediatric Use: The safety of Atrizin has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years.\r Elderly use: The clearance of Atrizin is reduced in elderly patients, but only in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance.\rTherapeutic Class\rSedating Anti-histamine\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAtrizin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal & perennial allergic rhinitis. It is also indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergen induced asthma.\r\nPharmacology\r\nCetirizine Hydrochloride is a potent H1 receptor antagonist without any significant anticholinergic and antiserotonic effects. At pharmacologically active dose levels, it has almost no drowsiness effect and does not cause behavioral changes. It inhibits the histamine-mediated early phase of the allergic reaction and also reduces the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of mediators associated with the late phase of the allergic reaction.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: Cetirizine 10 mg achieves peak plasma concentrations of 257 mcg/L within one hour of administration (980 mcg/L in children). Food does not affect the extent of absorption, but it may slightly reduce the rate.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMontril has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montril did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montril was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montril approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montril. No dosage adjustment for Montril is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montril.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontril is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montril can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montril should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montril should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montril. Although Montril is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montril and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nMontril has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montril did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montril was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montril approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montril. No dosage adjustment for Montril is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montril.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMontril is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montril can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montril should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montril should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montril. Although Montril is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montril and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Besides Deflazacort decreases the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system. By decreasing the release of these chemicals Deflazacort provides immunosuppressive action.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults-\rFor acute disorders: Up to 120 mg/day Deflazacort may need to be given initially. Maintenance doses in most conditions are within the range of 3-18 mg/day.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The maintenance dose is usually within the range of 3-18 mg/day. The smallest effective dose should be used and increased if necessary.\rBronchial asthma: In the treatment of an acute attack, high doses of 48-72 mg/day may be needed depending on severity and gradually reduced once the attack has been controlled. For maintenance in chronic asthma, doses should be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms.\rOther conditions: The dose of Deflazacort depends on clinical need titrated to the lowest effective dose for maintenance. Starting doses may be estimated on the basis of ratio of 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone to 6 mg.\rChildren: There has been limited exposure of children to Deflazacort in clinical trials. In children, the indications for glucocorticoids arethe same as for adults, but it is important that the lowest effective dosage is used. Alternate day administration may be appropriate. Doses of Deflazacort usually lie in the range 0.25-1.5 mg/kg/day.\r The following ranges provide general guidance:\rJuvenile chronic arthritis: The usual maintenance dose is between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day.\rNephrotic syndrome: Initial dose of usually 1.5 mg/kg/day followed by down titration according to clinical need.\rBronchial asthma: On the basis of the potency ratio, the initial dose should be between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg on alternate days.\rDeflazacort withdrawal: In patients who have received more than physiological doses of systemic corticosteroids (approximately 9 mg per day or equivalent) for greater than 3 weeks, withdrawal should not be abrupt. How dose reduction should be carried out depends largely on whether the disease is likely to relapse as the dose of systemic corticosteroids is reduced.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFlacort is metabolized in the liver. It is recommended to increase the maintenance dose of Flacort if drugs which are liver enzyme inducers are co-administered, e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone and aminoglutethimide. For drugs which inhibit liver enzymes, (e.g. ketoconazole) it may be possible to reduce the maintenance dose of Flacort.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to or any of the ingredients. Patients receiving live virus immunization.\rSide Effects\rGI disturbances, musculoskeletal, endocrine, neuropsychiatric, ophthalmic, fluid and electrolyte disturbances; susceptible to infection, impaired healing, hypersensitivity, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, acne, myocardial rupture following recent Ml, thromboembolism.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Deflazacort does cross the placenta. However, when administered for prolonged periods or repeatedly during pregnancy, corticosteroids may increase the risk of intrauterine growth retardation. As with all drugs, corticosteroids should only be prescribed when the benefits to the mother and child outweigh the risks.\r Nursing Mother: Corticosteroids are excreted in breast milk, although no data are available for Deflazacort. Doses of up to 50 mg daily of Deflazacort are unlikely to cause systemic effects in the infant. Infants of mothers taking higher doses than this may have a degree of adrenal suppression but the benefits of breastfeeding are likely to outweigh any theoretical risk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe following clinical conditions require special caution and frequent patient monitoring is necessary-\rCardiac disease or congestive heart failure (except in the presence of active rheumatic carditis), hypertension, thromboembolic disorders. Glucocorticoids can cause salt and water retention and increased excretion of potassium. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary.\rGastritis or oesophagitis, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis if there is the probability of impending perforation, abscess or pyogenic infections, fresh intestinal anastomosis, active or latent peptic ulcer.\rDiabetes mellitus or family history, osteoporosis, myasthenia gravis, renal insufficiency.\rEmotional instability or psychotic tendency, epilepsy.\rPrevious corticosteroid-induced myopathy.\rLiver failure.\rHypothyroidism and cirrhosis, which may increase the glucocorticoid effect.\rOcular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment, blood levels of may be increased. Therefore the dose of Flacort should be carefully monitored and adjusted to the minimum effective dose.\r Renal Impairment: In renally impaired patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy are necessary.\r Elderly: In elderly patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy are necessary. The common adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids may be associated with more serious consequences in old age.\rTherapeutic Class\rGlucocorticoids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool (below 25\u00b0C) and dry place, protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rMonas is indicated for:\rProphylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma\rAcute prevention of Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)\rRelief of symptoms of Allergic Rhinitis (AR): Seasonal & Perennial Allergic Rhinitis\rReversair - MedEx campaign banner\rMonas - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rMontelukast is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT1). The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMonas has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken.

But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Bilan shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Bilan 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue.

A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Bilan 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Bilan after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Bilan is not metabolized in human.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlanil does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Alanil with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alanil caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Alanil and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Alanil should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Alanil tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Alanil has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Alanil. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Alanil has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Alanil from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAllergic Rhinitis-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\r\nSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years:\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r\n \n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nAlanil does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Alanil with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alanil caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Alanil and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r\n \nFexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAllergic Rhinitis-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r\n \nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r\n \nAdults and children 12 years and older:\r\nTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 to 11 years:\r\nTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\r\nChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\r\nSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\r\nChildren from 2 to 11 years:\r\nSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\r\nIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r\n \n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRitch does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Ritch with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Ritch caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Ritch and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r\n \nThere are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Ritch should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Ritch tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Ritch has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r\n \nElderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Ritch. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Ritch has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Ritch from blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rReversair has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Reversair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Reversair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Reversair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Reversair. No dosage adjustment for Reversair is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Reversair.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rReversair is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Reversair can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Reversair should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Reversair should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Reversair. Although Reversair is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Reversair and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

It also has mast-cell stabilising properties.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and children above 12 years: The usual recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet daily.\rChildren below 12 years: Not recommended.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rSystemically administered Ketoconazole and Erythromycin, antiarrythmics e.g. Amiodarone moderately increase the plasma concentration of Mastel MR. This could increase the risk of arrythmias. Concurrent use of other potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme e.g. Ciclosporin should be approached with caution. No potentiation of the sedation and the alteration in performance caused by alcohol with Mastel MR has been observed.\rContraindications\rMizolastine is contra-indicated in patients with clinically significant cardiac disease or a history of symptomatic arrhythmias and in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, patients with electrolyte imbalance (particularly hypokalaemia), and in those with clinically significant bradycardia. It is also contra-indicated in patients taking other drugs that decrease its metabolism, patients with significantly impaired liver function, and in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug.\rSide Effects\rMastel MR is well tolerated in the recommended doses. The usual side effects are dry mouth, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, raised liver enzymes, hypotension, tachycardia and palpitations. Bronchospasm and aggravation of asthma were reported, but in view of the high frequency of asthma in the treated patient population, a causality relationship remains uncertain.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety of Mizolastine for use in human pregnancy has not been established. The evaluation of experimental animal studies does not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to the development of the embryo or foetus, the course of gestation and peri and post-natal development. Mizolastine should be avoided in pregnancy (particularly the 1 st trimester). Mizolastine is excreted into breast milk, therefore it is not recommended during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be warned that a small number of individuals may experience sedation. It is therefore advisable to determine individual response before driving or performing complicated task.\rOverdose Effects\rIn cases of overdosage, general symptomatic surveillance with cardiac monitoring including QT interval and cardiac rhythm for at least 24 hours is recommended, along with standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Studies in patients with renal insufficiency suggest that haemodialysis does not increase clearance of the drug.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place. Protect from light. It should be kept out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nMastel MR is indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions:\r\nSeasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (hay fever)\r\nPerennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis\r\nUrticaria\r\nPharmacology\r\nMizolastine, a non-sedating antihistamine, blocks histamine H1-receptors on effector cells of the GI tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It also has mast-cell stabilising properties.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult and children above 12 years: The usual recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet daily.\r\nChildren below 12 years: Not recommended.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nSystemically administered Ketoconazole and Erythromycin, antiarrythmics e.g. Amiodarone moderately increase the plasma concentration of Mastel MR. This could increase the risk of arrythmias. Concurrent use of other potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme e.g. Ciclosporin should be approached with caution. No potentiation of the sedation and the alteration in performance caused by alcohol with Mastel MR has been observed.\r\nContraindications\r\nMizolastine is contra-indicated in patients with clinically significant cardiac disease or a history of symptomatic arrhythmias and in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, patients with electrolyte imbalance (particularly hypokalaemia), and in those with clinically significant bradycardia. It is also contra-indicated in patients taking other drugs that decrease its metabolism, patients with significantly impaired liver function, and in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMastel MR is well tolerated in the recommended doses. The usual side effects are dry mouth, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, raised liver enzymes, hypotension, tachycardia and palpitations. Bronchospasm and aggravation of asthma were reported, but in view of the high frequency of asthma in the treated patient population, a causality relationship remains uncertain.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe safety of Mizolastine for use in human pregnancy has not been established.

It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Odmon did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Odmon was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Odmon approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Odmon. No dosage adjustment for Odmon is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Odmon.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOdmon is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Odmon can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Odmon should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Odmon should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Odmon. Although Odmon is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Odmon and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

This cream is composed of Econazole Nitrate, a powerful antifungal and Triamcinolone Acetonide to enforce its antimicrobial effect and the effect of subduing comprehensive inflammations, therefore, it provides remarkable effects on mixed infections of gram-positive and fungus, eczema and recurrent inflammations and shows special effects on bacterial inflammations of skin folds. The range of action of econazole covers all dermatomycoses caused by the following pathogens:- Dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Cladosporium, Yeasts, such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Moulds, Fungi, such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomycosis dermatitidis, and others. As well as Malassezia furfur and Nocardia minutissima.\r Moreover, it has antibacterial effect on gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Streptococcus pyogens and Staphylococcus aureus. It is also effective against Trichomonus vaginalis, versicolor and balanitis. On the other hand Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic steroid which inhibits not only the early phenomena of the inflammatory process but also the later manifestations.\r Pharmacological Properties: Econazole Nitrate is only slightly (<0.1%) absorbed from the skin. So no active drug has been detected in the serum. But Triamcinolone Acetonide is well absorbed from sites of local application.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: This cream should be applied sparingly to the skin lesion no more than 2 times daily, preferably once in the morning and once in the evening. This cream should not be applied with an occlusive dressing, or to large areas of skin on the body.

Compared to adults, the nature of a child's skin and the larger skin surface area relative to body weight may lead to an increased absorption of the corticosteroid via the child's skin. This cream should be used in children only for short periods of time (less than 2 weeks) and on small areas (less than 10% of body surface area).\r Visual disturbance may be associated with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).\rOverdose Effects\rThis Cream is for cutaneous application only. Corticosteroids applied to the skin, including triamcinolone, can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects. In the event of accidental ingestion, treat symptomatically.

This cream is composed of Econazole Nitrate, a powerful antifungal and Triamcinolone Acetonide to enforce its antimicrobial effect and the effect of subduing comprehensive inflammations, therefore, it provides remarkable effects on mixed infections of gram-positive and fungus, eczema and recurrent inflammations and shows special effects on bacterial inflammations of skin folds. The range of action of econazole covers all dermatomycoses caused by the following pathogens:- Dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Cladosporium, Yeasts, such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Moulds, Fungi, such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomycosis dermatitidis, and others. As well as Malassezia furfur and Nocardia minutissima.\r\n \nMoreover, it has antibacterial effect on gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Streptococcus pyogens and Staphylococcus aureus. It is also effective against Trichomonus vaginalis, versicolor and balanitis. On the other hand Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic steroid which inhibits not only the early phenomena of the inflammatory process but also the later manifestations.\r\n \nPharmacological Properties: Econazole Nitrate is only slightly (<0.1%) absorbed from the skin. So no active drug has been detected in the serum. But Triamcinolone Acetonide is well absorbed from sites of local application.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults: This cream should be applied sparingly to the skin lesion no more than 2 times daily, preferably once in the morning and once in the evening. This cream should not be applied with an occlusive dressing, or to large areas of skin on the body. The duration of treatment with this cream should continue until the inflammatory symptoms subside but not longer than 2 weeks; after 2 weeks of therapy with this cream, continue therapy as needed with a preparation containing econazole or econazole nitrate alone.\r\n \nPediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight.

        "description": "Indications\rRheumatoid Arthritis: Tofatin XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\r Psoriatic Arthritis: Tofatin XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\r Ulcerative Colitis: Tofatin XR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).\rPharmacology\rRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL7, IL15, IL21, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta. (3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway.\r Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.\rDosage & Administration\rRheumatoid Arthritis: Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or Tofacitinib 11 mg once daily. Recommended dosage in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment is Tofacitinib 5 mg once daily.\r Psoriatic Arthritis (in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs): Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or Tofacitinib 11 mg once daily.  Recommended dosage in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment is Tofacitinib 5 mg once daily.\r Ulcerative Colitis: Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks; then 5 or 10 mg twice daily. Discontinue after 16 weeks of 10 mg twice daily, if adequate therapeutic benefit is not achieved. Use the lowest effective dose to maintain response.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPotent inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (e.g., Ketoconazole)\rRecommended dose is Tofatin XR 5 mg once daily: One or more concomitant medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (e.g., fluconazole)\rRecommended dose is Tofatin XR 5 mg once daily Potent CYP inducers (e.g.Rifampin): May result in loss of or reduced clinical response.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first 3 months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with Tofatin XR monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea and nasopharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Tofacitinib should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r It is not known whether Tofacitinib is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tofacitinib, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSerious Infections: Avoid use of Tofatin XR during an active serious infection, including localized infections. \rGastrointestinal Perforations: Use with caution in patients that may be at increased risk.\rLaboratory Monitoring: Recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and lipids.\rImmunizations: Live vaccines: Avoid use with Tofatin XR.\rDo not initiate Tofatin XR if absolute lymphocyte count <500 cells/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin <9 gm/dL.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Tofatin XR in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: The frequency of serious infection among Tofatin XR-treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than among those under the age of 65. As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.\r Moderate and severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment: half the total daily dosage recommended for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.\rTherapeutic Class\rImmunosuppressant\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C.

However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Byloza after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Byloza is not metabolized in human.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Tofacitinib should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nIt is not known whether Tofacitinib is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tofacitinib, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSerious Infections: Avoid use of Tofacit XR during an active serious infection, including localized infections. \r\nGastrointestinal Perforations: Use with caution in patients that may be at increased risk.\r\nLaboratory Monitoring: Recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and lipids.\r\nImmunizations: Live vaccines: Avoid use with Tofacit XR.\r\nDo not initiate Tofacit XR if absolute lymphocyte count <500 cells/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin <9 gm/dL.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Tofacit XR in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: The frequency of serious infection among Tofacit XR-treated subjects 65 years of age and older was higher than among those under the age of 65. As there is a higher incidence of infections in the elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.\r\n \nModerate and severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment: half the total daily dosage recommended for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nImmunosuppressant\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 30\u00b0C.

The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rHydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.

Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Xyril is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Xyril with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\rContraindications\rHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rSide effects reported with the administration of Xyril Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rClinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, Hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe potentiating action of Xyril must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with Xyril, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of Xyril, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Xyril. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment patient: In case of renal impairment, half of the normal dose should be given.\r Use in the elderly patient: In the elderly, it is advised to start with half the recommended dose due to the prolonged action.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most common manifestation of Xyril overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\r If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and Levarterenol or Metaraminol. Epinephrine should not be used as Xyril counteracts its pressor action.\r There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with Xyril. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated.

        "description": "Indications\rEczacort is a topical corticosteroid indicated for relief of the inflammatory and pruritic\rmanifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults. The topical treatment of mild to moderate\ratopic dermatitis in pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age.\rPharmacology\rTopical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.\rCorticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively\rcalled lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of\rinflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor,\rarachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.\rDosage & Administration\rFor corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults, apply a thin film to the affected skin areas two or three times daily, depending on the severity of the condition, and rub in gently. For atopic dermatitis in patients 3 months to 18 years of age, apply a thin film to the affected skin areas two times daily, and rub in gently. Do not apply hydrocortisone butyrate in the diaper area unless directed by a physician. Discontinue therapy when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary. Before prescribing for more than 2 weeks, any additional benefits of extending treatment to 4 weeks should be weighed against the risk of HPA axis suppression and local adverse events.

Therefore, Hydrocortisone Butyrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.\r Lactation: It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk, in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSystemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\r(HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some\rpatients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent\rcorticosteroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.\rChildren may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible\rto systemic toxicity. If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate\rtherapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or\rantibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid\rshould be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 25\u00b0C. Protect from light. Do not freeze. Keep out of reach of children.\nIndications\r\nEczacort is a topical corticosteroid indicated for relief of the inflammatory and pruritic\r\nmanifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults. The topical treatment of mild to moderate\r\natopic dermatitis in pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age.\r\nPharmacology\r\nTopical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.\r\nCorticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively\r\ncalled lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of\r\ninflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor,\r\narachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in adults, apply a thin film to the affected skin areas two or three times daily, depending on the severity of the condition, and rub in gently. For atopic dermatitis in patients 3 months to 18 years of age, apply a thin film to the affected skin areas two times daily, and rub in gently. Do not apply hydrocortisone butyrate in the diaper area unless directed by a physician. Discontinue therapy when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMonocast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monocast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monocast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monocast. Although Monocast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monocast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monocast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monocast. Although Monocast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monocast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended.

        "description": "Indications\rPatadin eye drops is indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms (itchy, watery, red and swollen eyes and/or eyelids) of allergic conjunctivitis including vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratitis, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis.\r Olpadin 7 Nasal Spray is an H1 receptor antagonist indicated for the relief of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children 6 years of age and older.\r Olpadin 7 tablet is indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (swelling of the nasal membranes\rcaused by an allergy to pollen and mold spores in the air) and allergic skin conditions. It helps to relieve allergy symptoms such as skin rashes, swelling, hives (itchy, painful eruptions that sting), itching, sneezing, runny or stuffy nose.\rPharmacology\rOlopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies.\r Mode of Action: Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine. Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of Olopatadine Nasal Spray. Distribution: The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism: Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles of olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Elimination: The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion\rDosage\rEye Drops-\r0.1%: One drop in each affected eye two times per day at an interval of 6 to 8 hours.\r0.2%: One drop in the affected eye once a day.\r0.7%: One drop in each affected eye once a day.\rNasal Spray-\rAdminister Olopatadine Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only.\rAdults and Adolescents 12 years of age and older: Two sprays per nostril twice daily.\\\rChildren 6 to 11 years of age: One spray per nostril twice daily.\rTablet-\rAdults: Take 1 tablet (5 mg of the active ingredient) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease, age or symptoms.\rChildren 7 years old or over: Take 1 tablet (5 mg) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed.\rIf you miss a dose, take a dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and follow your regular dosing schedule. You should never take two doses at one time. Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor instructs you to do so.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rHow to use the Nasal Spray-\rShake the bottle gently and remove the dust cover.\rHold the spray with your forefinger and middle finger on either side of the nozzle and your thumb underneath the bottle. Press down until a fine spray appears. If using for the first time or if you have not used it for a week or more, press the nasal applicator several times until a fine moist comes out from the container.\rGently blow the nose to clear the nostrils.\rClose one nostril and carefully insert the nasal applicator into the open nostril. Tilt your head forward slightly and keep the spray upright. Breathe in through your nose and while breathing in, press the white-collar of nasal applicator firmly down once to release a spray.\rBreathe out through your mouth.\rRepeat the above steps in the same/ other nostril for consecutive doses.\rCleaning: The nasal spray should be cleaned at least once a week. The procedures are as follows-\rRemove the dust cover.\rGently pull off the nasal applicator.\rWash the applicator and dust cover in warm water.\rShake off the excess water and leave to dry in a normal place.

Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Drug interactions involving P450 inhibition and plasma protein binding are also not expected.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in persons with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Olopatadine 5 mg tablet is not recommended for use if you are allergic to it. Inform your doctor about your current medications and pre-existing medical conditions to make sure this medicine is safe for you.\rSide Effects\rRarely headaches have been reported. Other adverse effects: asthenia, blurred vision, burning or stinging, cold syndrome, dry eye, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, hypersensitivity, keratitis, lid edema, nausea, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis, sinusitis, and taste perversion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rOlopatadine was found not to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether topical ocular administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in the human breast milk. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Olopatadine is administered to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Olpadin 7 ophthalmic solution should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. Benzalkonium Chloride, preservative of Patadin, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red should be instructed to wait at least 10 minutes after instillation of Patadin eye drops before they insert their contact lenses. The treatment should be discontinued in the presence of an allergic reaction.\r Before initial use, Olpadin 7 Nasal Spray by releasing 5 sprays or until a fine mist appears. When Olpadin 7 Nasal Spray has not been used for more than 7 days, re-prime by releasing 2 sprays. Avoid spraying Olpadin 7 Nasal Spray into the eyes. Patients should be informed to avoid spraying Olpadin 7 Nasal Spray in their eyes.\r Olonex Tablet should be used as prescribed by your doctor. Take it at the same time every day to maintain a constant level of this medicine in your body. Avoid taking more than the recommended dose. Do not stop taking this medicine without consulting your doctor, as your symptoms may reoccur.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed betweents.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no information on Olpadin 7 overdose. However, excessive use of any medication can have serious consequences.

It is desirable that the contents should not be used more than one month after first opening of the bottle.\nIndications\r\nPatadin eye drops is indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms (itchy, watery, red and swollen eyes and/or eyelids) of allergic conjunctivitis including vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratitis, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis.\r\n \nOlpadin 7 Nasal Spray is an H1 receptor antagonist indicated for the relief of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children 6 years of age and older.\r\n \nOlpadin 7 tablet is indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (swelling of the nasal membranes\r\ncaused by an allergy to pollen and mold spores in the air) and allergic skin conditions. It helps to relieve allergy symptoms such as skin rashes, swelling, hives (itchy, painful eruptions that sting), itching, sneezing, runny or stuffy nose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nOlopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies.\r\n \nMode of Action: Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine. Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of Olopatadine Nasal Spray. Distribution: The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism: Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles of olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Elimination: The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion\r\nDosage\r\nEye Drops-\r\n0.1%: One drop in each affected eye two times per day at an interval of 6 to 8 hours.\r\n0.2%: One drop in the affected eye once a day.\r\n0.7%: One drop in each affected eye once a day.\r\nNasal Spray-\r\nAdminister Olopatadine Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only.\r\nAdults and Adolescents 12 years of age and older: Two sprays per nostril twice daily.\\\r\nChildren 6 to 11 years of age: One spray per nostril twice daily.\r\nTablet-\r\nAdults: Take 1 tablet (5 mg of the active ingredient) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease, age or symptoms.\r\nChildren 7 years old or over: Take 1 tablet (5 mg) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed.\r\nIf you miss a dose, take a dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and follow your regular dosing schedule. You should never take two doses at one time. Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor instructs you to do so.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nHow to use the Nasal Spray-\r\nShake the bottle gently and remove the dust cover.\r\nHold the spray with your forefinger and middle finger on either side of the nozzle and your thumb underneath the bottle.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r Children between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r Children between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant use of Biltin with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Biltin. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Biltin shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Biltin 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Biltin 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Biltin after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Biltin is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Biltin. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Biltin in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Biltin should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Biltin at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r\n \nChildren between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r\n \nChildren between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant use of Biltin with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Biltin. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Biltin shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Biltin 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\r\nContraindications\r\nBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nTreatment with Biltin 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Biltin after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Biltin is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Biltin. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nEfficacy and safety of Biltin in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Biltin should not be used in these age groups.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn clinical trials, after administration of Biltin at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were dizziness, headache and nausea. No serious adverse events and no significant prolongation in the QTc interval were reported.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

Read more\rDescription\rPheniramine is a competitive H1 histamine receptor antagonist. Like other alkylamine antihistamines it is also antagonist of muscarinic cholinergic receptors and possesses local anesthetic properties. However, the concentration required for the latter effect is probably not achieved at therapeutic dose\rPharmacology\rPheniramine competes with histamine for the histamine H1 receptor, acting as an inverse agonist once bound. The reduction in H1 receptor activity is responsible for reduced itching as well as reduced vasodilation and capillary leakage leading to less redness and edema. This can be seen in the suppression of the histamine-induced wheal (swelling) and flare (vasodilation) response. Inverse agonism of the H1 receptor in the CNS is also responsible for the sedation produced by first-generation antihistamines like pheniramine. The binding of pheniramine to H4 receptors, and subsequent inverse agonism, may also contribute to reduced itching by antagonizing inflammation.\rDosage & Administration\rDoses must be individually determined in all cases and should be taken with or soon after food. Treatment should be commenced at the lowest possible dose because experience has shown that antihistamines are often effective at low doses. The maximum dose of 3 mg/kg per day should not be exceeded. Elderly patients should use the adult dose with caution.\r To prevent travel sickness, it is recommended that the first dose be taken at least 30 minutes before traveling. Due to the risk of drowsiness, the patient should not drive a motor vehicle or operate machinery after taking a dose.\r Pheniramine Maleate tablets:\rIn adults and children over 10 years of age: Treatment is commenced with half a tablet taken up to three times daily. This dose may be increased to one tablet taken up to three times daily if required.\rChildren 5-10 years of age: Half a tablet up to three times daily. Pheniramine Maleate tablets are not recommended in children under 5 years of age.\r Interaction\rMAO-inhibitors may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of pheniramine (see Contraindications).\rAdverse CNS effects of pheniramine may be enhanced when it is taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants (eg. hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers).\rAtropine and related drugs may enhance the anticholinergic activity of pheniramine.\rContraindications\rPatients with hypersensitivity to pheniramine or any other ingredient (eg.

Accidental ingestion in small children has resulted in convulsions and sometimes death.\r Management: As there is no specific antidote, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Induction of vomiting should only be used immediately after ingestion as the sedative action of any absorbed antihistamine can lead to life-threatening pulmonary aspiration during emesis. Gastric lavage with a cuffed endotracheal tube in situ may be useful for some time after ingestion of antihistamines as their anticholinergic action slows down gastric emptying. Stimulants should not be used as they may precipitate convulsions. Diazepam or short-acting barbiturates may be used to control convulsions. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension.

The binding of pheniramine to H4 receptors, and subsequent inverse agonism, may also contribute to reduced itching by antagonizing inflammation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDoses must be individually determined in all cases and should be taken with or soon after food. Treatment should be commenced at the lowest possible dose because experience has shown that antihistamines are often effective at low doses. The maximum dose of 3 mg/kg per day should not be exceeded. Elderly patients should use the adult dose with caution.\r\n \nTo prevent travel sickness, it is recommended that the first dose be taken at least 30 minutes before traveling. Due to the risk of drowsiness, the patient should not drive a motor vehicle or operate machinery after taking a dose.\r\n \nPheniramine Maleate tablets:\r\nIn adults and children over 10 years of age: Treatment is commenced with half a tablet taken up to three times daily. This dose may be increased to one tablet taken up to three times daily if required.\r\nChildren 5-10 years of age: Half a tablet up to three times daily. Pheniramine Maleate tablets are not recommended in children under 5 years of age.\r\n \nInteraction\r\nMAO-inhibitors may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of pheniramine (see Contraindications).\r\nAdverse CNS effects of pheniramine may be enhanced when it is taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants (eg. hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers).\r\nAtropine and related drugs may enhance the anticholinergic activity of pheniramine.\r\nContraindications\r\nPatients with hypersensitivity to pheniramine or any other ingredient (eg. Methyl hydroxybenzoate or propyl hydroxybenzoate in the syrup).\r\nPatients with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy.\r\nPatients receiving MAO-inhibitor therapy.\r\nNewborn and premature infants.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reaction is sedation, which often disappears after a few days if tolerance is acquired. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Lassitude, dizziness, tinnitus, inability to concentrate, incoordination, irritability, insomnia and tremors. Agitation and convulsions, especially in children and restlessness, disorientation and hallucinations in adults, are common symptoms following overdose.\r\nGastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, colic, epigastric pain, anorexia, dryness of mouth and constipation.\r\nGenitourinary: Urinary retention.\r\nCardiovascular: Palpitations, headache.\r\nOcular: Blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure.\r\nMusculoskeletal: Muscular weakness.\r\nHaematological: Rare cases of blood dyscrasias including agranulocytosis and haemolytic anaemia have been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\npregnancy Category A. Use only if strictly indicated. Use only if strictly indicated.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPheniramine Maleate may cause drowsiness. Both the dosage and the time of administration should be carefully considered in patients whose activities (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery) demand special concentration.\r\nPatients should be cautioned against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Pheniramine Maleate may possibly be hallucinogenic in toxic doses. Due to the possible CNS stimulating effects of antihistamines, pheniramine has the potential for abuse.\r\nDue to the anticholinergic effect of pheniramine, caution and close monitoring are required if it is used in patients with conditions such as prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, asthma or severe cardiovascular disease.\r\nThe anti-emetic effect of pheniramine may mask the signs of other conditions. Products containing pheniramine should not be taken on an empty stomach.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Antihistamine drugs in toxic doses produce a complex of CNS excitatory and depressant effects. Accidental ingestion in small children has resulted in convulsions and sometimes death.\r\n \nManagement: As there is no specific antidote, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Induction of vomiting should only be used immediately after ingestion as the sedative action of any absorbed antihistamine can lead to life-threatening pulmonary aspiration during emesis. Gastric lavage with a cuffed endotracheal tube in situ may be useful for some time after ingestion of antihistamines as their anticholinergic action slows down gastric emptying. Stimulants should not be used as they may precipitate convulsions. Diazepam or short-acting barbiturates may be used to control convulsions. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension. Mechanical support of respiration may be required if respiration is seriously depressed. Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended if cardiac toxicity develops, which can be treated with centrally-acting anticholinesterases such as physostigmine.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSedating Anti-histamine\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light. Do not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\r\n",

Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.

Coadministration of Telfast with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Telfast caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Telfast and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Telfast should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Telfast tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Telfast has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Telfast. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Telfast has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Telfast from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Trilock did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Trilock was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Trilock approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Trilock. No dosage adjustment for Trilock is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Trilock.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTrilock is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Trilock can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Trilock should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Trilock should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Trilock. Although Trilock is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Trilock and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rClobederm is indicated for adults, elderly and children over 1 year in following dermatoses.\rPsoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis)\rRecalcitrant dermatoses\rLichen planus\rDiscoid lupus erythematosus\rOther skin conditions which do not respond satisfactorily to less potent steroids\rComposition\rClobetasol Propionate Cream: Each gram cream contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r Clobetasol Propionate Ointment: Each gram ointment contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r Clobetasol Propionate Scalp Application: Each gram lotion contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo: Each gram shampoo contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r Clobetasol Propionate Lotion: Each gram lotion contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r Clobetasol Propionate Spray: Each gram spray contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\rPharmacology\rClobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Cutaneous.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Clobederm is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light and moisture. Do not freeze.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rBiltin - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r Children between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r Children between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant use of Bilastin with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Bilastin. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Bilastin shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Bilastin 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Bilastin 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Bilastin after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Bilastin is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Bilastin. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Bilastin in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Bilastin should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Bilastin at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were dizziness, headache and nausea.

It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day.

Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no clinical data available on the exposure of Rupatadine during pregnancy. Pregnant women should therefore not use Rupatadine unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the infant. No information is available, whether Rupatadine is excreted in the mother's milk.

It also antagonizes the platelet activating factor (PAF). Both histamine and PAF cause broncho constriction which leads to an increase in the vascular permeability and act as a mediator in the inflammatory process. With the dual mode of action, Rupatadine shows better therapeutic effect than an isolated antihistamine. Rupatadine possesses other anti allergic properties such as the inhibition of the degranulation of mast cells induced by immunological and non immunological stimuli and inhibition of the release of cytokines, particularly of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF \u03b1) in human mastocytes and monocytes.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents (over 12 years): The recommended dose is 10 mg once a day. Rupatadine may be taken with or without food.\r\n \nChildren aged 2 to 11 years:\r\nChildren weighing 25 kg or more: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) of the oral solution once daily with or without food.\r\nChildren weighing equal or more than 10 kg to less than 25 kg: 1/2 teaspoonful (2.5 ml) oral solution once daily with or without food.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nWith medicine: The concomitant administration of Rupadin 20 mg and ketoconazole or erythromycin increases the systemic exposure. Rupadin should be used with caution when it is administered concomitantly with these drug substances and other inhibitors of the isozyme CYP3A4. Rupadin should be used with caution when it is co-administered with statins, CNS depressants or alcohol.\r\n \nWith food: Grapefruit and Grapefruit juice should not be taken simultaneously with Rupatadine\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to Rupatadine or to any of the excipients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness. Uncommon: Appetite increased, arthralgia, back pain, concentration impaired, constipation, cough, diarrhea, dry throat, epistaxis, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, increased risk of infection, irritability, malaise, myalgia, nasal dryness, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, rash, thirst, vomiting, weight increased. Rare: Palpitations, tachycardia.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere is no clinical data available on the exposure of Rupatadine during pregnancy. Pregnant women should therefore not use Rupatadine unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the infant. No information is available, whether Rupatadine is excreted in the mother's milk. Therefore, it should not be used during lactation, unless the potential benefits for the mother justify the potential risk to the infant.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRupadin should be used with caution in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, and patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia. Rupadin should be used with caution in elderly patients (65 years and older). As there is no clinical experience in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, the use of Rupadin 10 mg tablets is at present not recommended in these patients.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: Rupadin should be used with caution in elderly. No information is available that indicates the requirement of any dose adjustment in this population.\r\n \nChildren: Neither the safety nor the efficacy of Rupadin has been established in patients less than 12 years of age.\r\n \nPatients with renal or hepatic insufficiency: Use of Rupadin is not recommended in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. As no relevant clinical data is available.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reaction was somnolence. If accidental ingestion of very high doses occurs, symptomatic treatment together with the required supportive measures should be given.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFexomin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexomin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexomin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexomin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexomin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexomin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexomin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexomin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexomin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexomin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rLoratadine tablet provides fast, effective relief from the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis and skin allergies including chronic urticaria. It is also effective in alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing, nasal discharge, itching, ocular itching and burning. Nasal and ocular sign and symptoms are relieved rapidly after oral administration. Loratadine tablet is also indicated in idiopathic urticaria. In children over 2 years Loratadine tablet is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic skin conditions such as urticaria, nettlerash.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet is a preparation of Loratadine. Loratadine is a non-sedative histamine Hr receptor antagonist with antiallergic properties. Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral Hi-receptor antagonistic activity and no central sedative or anticholinergic effect. It is rapidly effective and long-lasting, allowing once-a-day administration.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and children over 12 years of age: One Loratadine tablet once daily. It is usually administered in the morning or when symptoms require treatment.\r Children 2-12 years: Body weight over 30 kg: one Loratadine tablet once daily, below 30 kg: half Loratadine tablet once daily.\r Below 2 years of age: Loratadine tablet is not recommended for use below 2 years of age since safety and efficacy has not been established.\r Interaction\rThere are no reports of potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs. In contrast to many other histamine H1 receptor antagonists, Loratadine has no potentiating effects when administered concurrently with alcohol, as measured by psychomotor performance studies. Concomitant therapy with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by hepatic cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 may elevate plasma concentrations of either drug and this mayifesult in adverse effects. Cimetidine inhibits both enzymes while erythromycin or ketoconazole inhibits P450 3A4. These drugs increase loratadine serum concentrations but no adverse effects are reported.\rContraindications\rLoratadine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to their components.\rSide Effects\rDuring controlled clinical studies the incidence of adverse events, including sedation and anticholinergic effects observed with 10 mg Loratadine was comparable to that observed with placebo. Studies on the effect of Loratadine on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning have shown it to be comparable to placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no experience of the use of Loratadine in human pregnancy. Therefore its use during pregnancy is not advisable. Loratadine is excreted in breast milk in a very small amount. So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\rOverdose Effects\rIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg. Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children with overdoses of greater than 10 mg. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary. It would seem reasonable to treat patients presenting early after large overdoses with oral activated charcoal. The conscious patients may be induced to vomit or gastric lavage may be performed.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

So nursing mothers are advised not to take the drug.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution should be taken in patients with liver impairment or renal insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min).\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn adults somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdose greater than 10 mg. Extrapyramidal signs and palpitations have been reported in children with overdoses of greater than 10 mg. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be instituted promptly and maintained for as long as necessary. It would seem reasonable to treat patients presenting early after large overdoses with oral activated charcoal. The conscious patients may be induced to vomit or gastric lavage may be performed.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rAllergic rhinitis: Fexomin is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 12 years of age and over. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFexomin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexomin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexomin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexomin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexomin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexomin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexomin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexomin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexomin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexomin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rHydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension-\rAdults: 50-100 mg 4 times daily.\rChildren (>6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rPruritus due to allergic conditions-\rAdults: 25 mg 3 to 4 times daily.\rChildren ( 6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rAs a sedative (premedication and following general anesthesia)-\rAdults: 50-100 mg.\rChildren: 0.6 mg/kg of body weight.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rArtica may potentiate Meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Artica is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Artica with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\rContraindications\rHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rSide effects reported with the administration of Artica Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rClinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, Hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe potentiating action of Artica must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with Artica, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of Artica, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Artica. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment patient: In case of renal impairment, half of the normal dose should be given.\r Use in the elderly patient: In the elderly, it is advised to start with half the recommended dose due to the prolonged action.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most common manifestation of Artica overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\r If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and Levarterenol or Metaraminol. Epinephrine should not be used as Artica counteracts its pressor action.\r There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with Artica. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. There is no practical method to quantitate Artica in body fluids or tissue after its ingestion or administration.\rTherapeutic Class\rSedating Anti-histamine\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place. Protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children.\rPack Image of Artica 25 mg Tablet\rPack Image: Artica 25 mg Tablet\nIndications\r\nArtica Hydrochloride is indicated-\r\nFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.\r\nManagement of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus.\r\nAs a sedative when used as premedication and following general anesthesia.\r\nThe effectiveness of Artica as an antianxiety agent for long-term use (>4 months) has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nHydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension-\r\nAdults: 50-100 mg 4 times daily.\r\nChildren (>6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\r\nChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\r\nPruritus due to allergic conditions-\r\nAdults: 25 mg 3 to 4 times daily.\r\nChildren ( 6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\r\nChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\r\nAs a sedative (premedication and following general anesthesia)-\r\nAdults: 50-100 mg.\r\nChildren: 0.6 mg/kg of body weight.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nArtica may potentiate Meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Artica is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Artica with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\r\nContraindications\r\nHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects reported with the administration of Artica Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFexofast does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fexofast with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fexofast caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fexofast and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexofast should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fexofast tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fexofast has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fexofast. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fexofast has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fexofast from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, itchy, red eyes and itchy nose/palate/throat ... Read more\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlanil does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Alanil with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Alanil caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Alanil and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Alanil should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Alanil tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Alanil has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Alanil. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Alanil has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Alanil from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rFenadin does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Fenadin with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Fenadin caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Fenadin and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common \u22651/10; Common \u22651/100 and <1/10; Uncommon \u22651/1,000 and <1/100; Rare \u22651/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fenadin should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Fenadin tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Fenadin has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Fenadin. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Fenadin has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Fenadin from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r Children between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r Children between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant use of Zilas with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Zilas. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Zilas shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Zilas 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\rContraindications\rBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Zilas 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Zilas after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Zilas is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Zilas. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\rUse in Special Populations\rEfficacy and safety of Zilas in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Zilas should not be used in these age groups.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, after administration of Zilas at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo.

Even at a high concentration, Bilastine does not show affinity for the 30 other receptors including muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, for the other histamine receptor subtypes (H2, H3 and H4). It shows excellent safety profile and very favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bilastine doesn\u2019t undergo any metabolism to be active. Bilastine is excreted by feces (non -systemic) & urine (systemic) approximately 66.35% & 28.31% respectively.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults & adolescents (12 years of age and over): 20 mg tablet once daily for symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, urticaria and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg Bilastine (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken. 20 mg Bilastine tablet (1 tablet) once daily should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach to achieve optimal exposure to Bilastine.\r\n \nChildren between 6 to 11 years: 10 mg mouth dissolving tablet for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The Mouth dissolving tablet is for oral use only. It should be placed in the mouth. It will disperse rapidly in saliva and can be easily swallowed. Alternatively, the mouth dissolving tablet can be dispersed in a tea spoon of water before being swallowed by the children. The maximum recommended daily dose for children in between 6 to 11 years is 10 mg Bilastine mouth dissolving tablet (1 tablet) and should not be exceeded. If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be taken. An extra dose should not be taken.\r\n \nChildren between 2 to 11 years: 4 ml once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant use of Zilas with ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine or diltiazem increases the concentration of Zilas. But these changes do not appear to affect the safety profile of any of the drugs. Intake of alcohol and 20 mg Zilas shows same psychomotor performance similar to that of alcohol and placebo. Concomitant intake of Zilas 20 mg and lorazepam 3 mg for 8 days did not potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\r\nContraindications\r\nBilastine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of the tablet.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported side effects in clinical trial are headache, dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. These adverse events occurred with a comparable frequency in patients receiving placebo.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of Bilastine in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, parturition or postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bilastine during pregnancy. The excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans. A decision must be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of Bilastine therapy for the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nTreatment with Zilas 20 mg does not affect the driving performance. However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines. In clinical trials elderly patients (\u226565 years) showed no difference in effcacy or safety with respect to younger patients. The maximum plasma concentration of Zilas after administration of 20 mg in patients with severe renal impairment is below the safety threshold of most common adverse e?ects and cardiac or CNS safety. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Zilas is not metabolized in human. Since renal elimination is the major excretion, biliary excretion is expected to be only marginally involved in the elimination of Zilas. Changes in liver function are not expected to have a clinically relevant influence.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nEfficacy and safety of Zilas in children under 2 years of age have not been established and there is little clinical experience in children aged 2 to 5 years, therefore Zilas should not be used in these age groups.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn clinical trials, after administration of Zilas at doses 10 to 11 times the therapeutic dose (220 mg as single dose; or 200 mg/day for 7 days) frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently reported were dizziness, headache and nausea. No serious adverse events and no significant prolongation in the QTc interval were reported.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon-sedating antihistamines\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rProvair ODT has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair ODT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair ODT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair ODT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair ODT. No dosage adjustment for Provair ODT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Provair ODT.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rProvair ODT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Provair ODT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Provair ODT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Provair ODT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Provair ODT. Although Provair ODT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Provair ODT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00b0C, protect from light & moisture.

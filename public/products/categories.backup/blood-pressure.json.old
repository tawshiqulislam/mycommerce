Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstriction and aldosterono secreting effects of angiotensin 11 by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin 11 to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues. Osartil is now regarded as the first-line therapy option for treating high blood pressure.\r Indications\r Losartan is indicated for the treatment of all grades of hypertension, Chronic heart failure, Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH and Nephropathy in type 2 Diabetes. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is an alternative for patients who have to discontinue an ACE inhibitor because of persistent dry cough.\r Dosage and Administration\r Hypertension: The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily. In patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or patients with a history of hepatic impairment, starting dose is 25 mg once daily. Losartan can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly or renal impairment patients. If blood pressure is not controlled by Losartan, a low dose of a diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide) may be added. Losartan may be administered with or without food. Chronic heart failure: 12.5 mg once daily, increased at weekly intervals to 50 mg once daily it tolerated. Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH: 50 mg once daily. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily should Maximum dose-Losartan 100 mg followed by Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily. Nephropathy in type 2 Diabetes: 50 mg once daily. Maximum dose-100 mg once daily.\rSide effects\r Overall incidence of adverse effects of Losartan is comparable to placebo in clinica studies. The most common adverse events occuring with Losartan at a rate of >19 above placebo were upper respiratory infection (7.9% vs 6.9%), dizziness (3.5% 2.1%) and leg pain (1.0% vs 0.0%).\r Precautions\r Losartan should be used with caution in patients with hypersensitivity to drugs that act through renin-angiotensin system. Special precaution should be ta when it is administered to the patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Safety effectivenss of Losartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Contraindications\r Losartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the active ingred\r or any component of the drug. Use in Pregnancy and Lactation\r Losartan must be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected should not be prescribed during lactation as there is no information in humans on\r passage of Losartan into breast milk.\r Drug interactions\r No drug interactions of clinical significance have been identified. Drugs which H been studied in clinical pharmacokinetic trials include (1) Hydrochlorothiazide Digoxin, (3) Warfarin, (4) Cimetidine, (5) Ketoconazole and (6) Phenobarbital.\r Storage\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoren is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rBisoren is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisoren fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisoren fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoren in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisoren fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Bisoren fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoren in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rNebita is indicated in-\rHypertension\rTreatment of essential hypertension\rChronic heart failure (CHF)\rTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\rPharmacology\rNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNebita should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Nebita should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebita may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebita and clonidine, Nebita should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebita is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebita should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebita is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebita should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebita be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebita should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebita should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebita was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebita is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebita can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebita has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebita has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebita is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r\n \nDigoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r\n \nWarfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNebita should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r\n \nNebita should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebita may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebita and clonidine, Nebita should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r\n \nCYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebita is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\r\nContraindications\r\nNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebita should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebita is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebita should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebita be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r\n \nCardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebita should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebita should be considered.\r\n \nAngina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebita was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r\n \nBronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r\n \nAnesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebita is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebita can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r\n \nThyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r\n \nPeripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r\n \nNon-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nImpaired Renal Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebita has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r\n \nImpaired Hepatic Function: Nebita should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebita has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebita is contraindicated in this population. \r\n \nRisk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisocor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisocor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisocor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisocor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisocor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisocor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted.

Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bislol fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Bislol fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bislol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rOsartil Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Prazopress ER is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Prazopress ER can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Prazopress ER is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Prazopress ER may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Prazopress ER indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress ER is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPrazopress ER XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Prazopress ER therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Prazopress ER therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Prazopress ER, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Prazopress ER when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Prazopress ER. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Prazopress ER XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Prazopress ER therapy.\r Left Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Prazopress ER has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Prazopress ER will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Prazopress ER decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Prazopress ER is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress ER decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Prazopress ER is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Prazopress ER is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Prazopress ER is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Prazopress ER in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Prazopress ER is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Prazopress ER is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily. If necessary, the dosage may be increased to 5/25 mg two tablets daily or as advised by the physicians. The dosage however should be individualized.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDisopyramide: Atenolol reduces the clearance of disopyramide by 20%. Additive negative inotropic effects on the heart may be produced.\r Ampicillin: at doses of 1 gm and above may reduce Atenolol levels.\r Oral antidiabetics and insulin: Beta-blockers may decrease tissue sensitivity to insulin and inhibit insulin secretion e.g. in response to oral antidiabetics. Atenolol has less potential for these actions.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to either component, sinus bradycardia, second and higher degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, congestive heart failure, poor left ventricular function.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Amlodipine and Atenolol is well tolerated. Overall side-effects include\rfatigue, headache, edema, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety and depression.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe combination should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential fetal risk. The combination should not be used by nursing mothers. If its use is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be stopped.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospasm: The combination should be used with caution in patients with airway obstruction.\r Renal impairment: The combination can be used in patients with renal impairment. However, caution may be necessary if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min because of possible reduction in the excretion of unchanged Atenolol.\r Hepatic impairment: Caution may be necessary in the use of the combination in patients with severe liver damage because of prolongation of the elimination half-life of Amlodipine.\r Drug withdrawal: Since coronary heart disease may exist without being recognized, patients should be warned against stopping the drug suddenly.

It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amdocal is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amdocal is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amdocal may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amdocal used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amdocal is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amdocal have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amdocal should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute Coronary Syndrome: In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel with a single 300 mg (4 tablets) oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiating it without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days.\r Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease: 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose.\r It is given orally with or without food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNSAIDs, warfarin, selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs): Increases risk of bleeding\rCYP2C19 inhibitors (omeprazole or esomeprazole): Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole\rRepaglinide (CYP2C8 substrates): Avoid concomitant use of Anclog with Repaglinide as it increases plasma concentrations of Repaglinide\rContraindications\rClopidogrel is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product.

A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs it is a prodrug, so metabolism to its active metabolite is impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 (poor metabolizer) and by the drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 such as Omeprazole and Esomeprazole. Concomitant use with these drugs and in CYP2C19 poor metaboliser may reduce the antiplatelet activity of Anclog.\rAs it inhibits platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), risk of bleeding may increase. To restore hemostasis, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\rDiscontinuation of Anclog increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume Anclog as soon as hemostasis is achieved.\rThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).\rHypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.\rUse in Special Populations\rSafety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been established. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature in a dry place. Protected from light. Do not freeze. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)]. It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome: In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel with a single 300 mg (4 tablets) oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiating it without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days.\r\n \nRecent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease: 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose.\r\n \nIt is given orally with or without food.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNSAIDs, warfarin, selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs): Increases risk of bleeding\r\nCYP2C19 inhibitors (omeprazole or esomeprazole): Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole\r\nRepaglinide (CYP2C8 substrates): Avoid concomitant use of Anclog with Repaglinide as it increases plasma concentrations of Repaglinide\r\nContraindications\r\nClopidogrel is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesan was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nAmiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Bizoran drug is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rOlmedip - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).\rDosage & Administration\rSubstitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil.

Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Bizoran drug is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.\r\nOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\r\nOlmedip - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r\n \nAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r\n \nOlmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSubstitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.\r\n \nInitial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily. Due to decreased clearance of Amlodipine among elderly patients the recommended starting dose of Amlodipine is 2.5 mg in patients 75 years.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\rPharmacology\rIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where Irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure. \r Elderly: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly\r Paediatric: Irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Cavapro.\r Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended.\r Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with Cavapro so far. Therefore, Cavapro is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid > 3 g/day and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Additional information on Cavapro interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r Lactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r Hyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension.

Pregnancy.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r\n \nLactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r\n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r\n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r\n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r\n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r\n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

It is used in the management of classical and vasospastic angina pectoris. It has also been used in the treatment of essential hypertension. It is used for prophylaxis of some selected supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\rPharmacology\rDiltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium channel antagonist. It is a peripheral and coronary vasodilator with some negative inotropic activity. Diltiazem inhibits cardiac conduction particularly at the sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. Diltiazem has the following actions:\r Antianginal: A direct dilatation of coronary arteries and arterioles proved oxygen supply to myocardial tissues. In addition dilatation of the peripheral vasculature reduces systemic pressure of cardiac \"after load\" which results in lessened stress and reduced oxygen requirements of the myocardial tissues.\r Antiarrhythmic: The inhibited influx of calcium ions in cardiac tissues result in slowed electrophysiological activity through the S-A and A-V nodes without affecting accessory bypass conduction or altering normal atrial action potential or intraventricular conduction.\r Antihypertensive: Reduces peripheral vascular resistance as a result of vasodilatation. More than 90% of an oral dose is rapidly absorbed. Protein binding is very high. Peak plasma concentration reaches within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolised in the liver and excreted (60%) through bile.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated formulation: The usual dose of Diltiazem Hydrochloride film coated tablet is 60 mg thrice daily. However patient's response may vary and dosage requirements can differ significantly between individual patients. If necessary, the divided dose may be increased to 180-300 mg/day. Dosage may be started as 30 mg four times daily and increasing at 1 to 2 days intervals until the optimum response is achieved. Higher doses upto 480 mg/day have been used with benefit in some patients especially in unstable angina.

It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage\rHypertension: The usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs within 4 weeks. \r Heart failure: The usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily. \r Post-Myocardial Infarction: The initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily.

Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

        "description": "Indications\rAbetis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rAbetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids.

In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Ransys.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Ransys. The most likely effects of Ransys overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Ransys requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telcardis Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised before taking Telcardis Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telcardis Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telcardis Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telcardis Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children. Keep in a cool and dry place. Protect from light.\nIndications\r\nTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telcardis Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents.

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r\n \nThere is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r\n \nTelmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nBlockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\r\nTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\r\nHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\r\nTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCaution should be exercised before taking Telcardis Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telcardis Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telcardis Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telcardis Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep out of the reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Selomet in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Selomet has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Selomet concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Selomet. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Selomet may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Selomet should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Selomet have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Selomet cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Selomet in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Selomet has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker.

Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated tablet-\r\nHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\r\nAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\r\nCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\r\nHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\r\nMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\r\nExtended-release tablet-\r\nHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\r\nAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\r\nHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\r\nIV Injection-\r\nArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\r\nIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\r\nMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Selomet concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Selomet. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\r\nContraindications\r\nAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\r\nSide Effects\r\nTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Selomet may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r\n \nMajor Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nHepatic impaired patient: Selomet should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r\n \nPediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Selomet have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Selomet cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Prazopress is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Prazopress can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Prazopress is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Prazopress may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Prazopress indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPrazopress XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Prazopress therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Prazopress therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Prazopress, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Prazopress when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Prazopress. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Prazopress XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Prazopress therapy.\r Left Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Prazopress has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Prazopress will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Prazopress decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Prazopress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Prazopress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Prazopress is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Prazopress is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Prazopress in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Prazopress is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Prazopress is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Prazopress can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: Prazopress is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Prazopress may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Prazopress indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r\n \nThe therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\r\nHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\r\nPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\r\nPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\r\nPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\r\nPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\r\nLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies.

The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r\n \nPrazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r\n \nMaintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r\n \nHypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily.

Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPrazopress ER XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Prazopress ER therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Prazopress ER therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Prazopress ER, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Prazopress ER when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Prazopress ER. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Prazopress ER XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Prazopress ER therapy.\r Left Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Prazopress ER has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Prazopress ER will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Prazopress ER decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Prazopress ER is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress ER decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Prazopress ER is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Prazopress ER is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Prazopress ER is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Prazopress ER in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Prazopress ER is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Prazopress ER is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Prazopress ER can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: Prazopress ER is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Prazopress ER may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Prazopress ER indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Prazopress ER is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r\n \nThe therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\r\nHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\r\nPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\r\nPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\r\nPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\r\nPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\r\nLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r\n \nSuggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r\n \nUse Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r\n \nSuggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r\n \nUsual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r\n \nPrazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r\n \nMaintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r\n \nHypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r\n \nThe addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nPrazopress ER XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\r\nCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\r\nHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\r\ntranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\r\nantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\r\nanalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\r\nContraindications\r\nPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common reactions associated with Prazopress ER therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea.

Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNebicard should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Nebicard should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebicard may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebicard and clonidine, Nebicard should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebicard is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebicard should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebicard is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebicard should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebicard be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebicard should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebicard should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebicard was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebicard is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebicard can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Nebicard should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebicard has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Nebicard should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebicard has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebicard is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\rPharmacology\rIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where Irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure. \r Elderly: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly\r Paediatric: Irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Cavapro.\r Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended.\r Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with Cavapro so far. Therefore, Cavapro is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid > 3 g/day and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Additional information on Cavapro interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r Lactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r Hyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension.

The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\r\nContraindications\r\nConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r\n \nLactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r\n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r\n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r\n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r\n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r\n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rCardicor is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rCardicor is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Cardicor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Cardicor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Cardicor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Cardicor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Cardicor fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Cardicor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated:\rTo reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class ll-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.\rFor the treatment of symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients aged one year and older.\rThis is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or other ARB.\rPharmacology\rThis tablet contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. This tablet inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of this tablet in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult Heart Failure: The recommended starting dose is 49/51 mg orally twice daily.

This tablet inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of this tablet in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult Heart Failure: The recommended starting dose is 49/51 mg orally twice daily. Double the dose after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.\r\n \nReduce the starting dose to 24/26 mg twice daily for:\r\nPatients not currently taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or previously taking a low dose of these agents.\r\nPatients with severe renal impairment.\r\nPatients with moderate hepatic impairment.\r\nPediatric Heart Failure: Refer to Table 1 for the recommended dose for pediatric patients aged one year and older.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

        "description": "Indications\rRipril indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in renal impairment:\rFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\rFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ripril and cause deterioration of renal function.\rContraindications\rRamipril must not be used\rin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\rin patients with a history of angioedema.\rconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\rin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\rin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\rwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\rwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\rduring pregnancy.\rConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\rSide Effects\rRipril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRipril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ripril.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ripril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ripril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ripril daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ripril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ripril.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmecar is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmecar was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmecar is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmecar, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmecar and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmecar may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmecar has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmecar was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmecar and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmecar and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmecar and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmecar, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmecar (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmecar. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmecar.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmecar. The most likely effects of Olmecar overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmecar requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmecar was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmecar is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmecar, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmecar and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmecar may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmecar has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmecar was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmecar and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmecar and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmecar and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmecar, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmecar (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmecar. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmecar.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Olmecar. The most likely effects of Olmecar overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmecar requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesartan Medoxomil & Hydrochlorothiazide combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily.

Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nOlmesartan Medoxomil & Hydrochlorothiazide combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHypertension: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily. Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks to two tablets 40/25 once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOlmesartan: No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesartan Medoxomil was co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers.

Moreover Nidipine SR is also used in Raynaud's phenomenon & heart failure.\rPharmacology\rNifedipine is an inhibitor of Calcium Channel Blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of Calcium ions into muscle cells. Nifedipine has selective effects as a dilator of arterial vessels. Nifedipine dilates main coronary and systemic arteries. As a result blood pressure falls and this elicits a sympathetic reflex response causing tachycardia and an increased cardiac output. Pulmonary arterial pressure also falls. Nifedipine has direct negative inotropic effects on cardiac muscles and these effects are seen at higher doses than dose which causes arterial vasodilatation.\rDosage & Administration\rNifedipine 10 mg:\rAngina: Initially 10 mg 3 times daily with food increased to 20 mg 3 times daily if necessary, in elderly patients, initially 5 mg 3 times daily.\rRaynaud's Phenomenon: 10 mg 3 times daily; maximum 60 mg daily. In urgent cases, the tablet should be dissolved under the tongue like a sublingual tablet. The effect occurs within some minutes.\rNifedipine 20 mg: The starting dose for patients, not previously prescribed Nifedipine products is one tablet once daily. The recommended dose in hypertension and angina prophylaxis is 20 mg twice daily during or after food.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBisocor Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bisocor Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bisocor Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Bisocor Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bisocor Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Bisocor Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bisocor Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere are limited data on overdose with Bisocor Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

Trimetazidine Dihydrochloride inhibits fatty acid pathway by inhibiting 3-keto acyl CoA thiolase enzyme and transfers oxygen to glucose pathway. Since glucose pathway is more efficient in producing energy, the same oxygen produces more energy and makes the heart more active. Moreover, the aerobic oxidation of glucose stops production of lactic acid, which prevents angina pectoris.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Trimetazidine is 35 mg twice daily or 20 mg tablet thrice daily during meals.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r Renal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Angilock is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\rPharmacology\rLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Angilock. Concomitant use of Angilock and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Angilock are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy.

In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Angilock is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Angilock is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan.

Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Angilock are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Angilock during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Angilock is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Angilock is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Angilock should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Angilock is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r\n \nRenal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Angilock is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\r\nPharmacology\r\nLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r\n \nPatients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r\n \nPatients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Angilock.

        "description": "Indications\rAngilock Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated in the treatment of essential hypertension where blood pressure is not adequately controlled on perindopril alone.\rPharmacology\rPerindopril is a nonsulphydryl ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension. Following oral administration, perindopril is rapidly hydrolysed to perindoprilat, its principal active metabolite. ACE catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE activity leads to decreased levels of angiotensin II, thereby resulting in decreased vasoconstriction and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter change may result in a small increase in serum potassium. Decreased levels of angiotensin II and the accompanying lack of negative feedback on renal renin secretion results in increases in plasma renin activity. Perindopril administration may interfere with the degradation of the vasodepressor peptide bradykinin. It is not known whether this effect contributes to the therapeutic activity of perindopril. The mechanism through which perindopril lowers BP appears to result primarily from suppression of the RAAS.\r Indapamide is a sulphonamide derivative with an indole ring, pharmacologically related to the thiazide group of diuretics. Indapamide inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in the cortical diluting segment. It increases the urinary excretion of sodium and chlorides and, to a lesser extent, the excretion of potassium and magnesium, thereby increasing urine output and having an antihypertensive action.\rDosage & Administration\r1-2 tablets per day preferably taken in the morning before a meal.

        "description": "Indications\rCoveram is indicated as substitution therapy for the treatment of hypertension and/or stable coronary heart disease in patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril and amlodipine, given concurrently at the same dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with Coveram.\rPharmacology\rPerindopril, a pro-drug, is hydrolyzed to perindoprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor, which stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with an increase in serum potassium \r Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses.\rDosage & Administration\rperindopril arginine & amlodipine is as substitution therapy for patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril (5 or 10 mg) and amlodipine (5 or 10 mg), given concurrently at the dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with this combination.\r Food intake may reduce hepatic biotransformation of perindopril to perindoprilat. Recommended treatment is one tablet per day as a single dose, preferably to be taken in the morning and before a meal. As perindopril and amlodipine may be used for different clinical indications, dose adjustments should be based on clinical judgment and the individual patient profile.\r Adjustments can be made by decreasing or increasing the dose of either perindopril and/or amlodipine using separate perindopril and/or amlodipine products within the recommended dose range until clinical stability is re-established. Consult the Product Information of the individual perindopril and/or amlodipine products being used when adjusting the dose.\r In the event that down-titration is required, adjustments using amlodipine 2.5 mg or a dose of perindopril equivalent to perindopril arginine 2.5 mg, as separate products should be considered until clinical stability is re-established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBaclofen may increase the antihypertensive effect of Coveram. Monitor blood pressure and renal function, and adjust the dose of Coveram if necessary. Combined use of these medicines may increase the hypotensive effects of perindopril and amlodipine. Combined use with nitroglycerine and other nitrates or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood pressure and therefore should be considered with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated:\rIn patients with a history of previous hypersensitivity to either of the active ingredients; perindopril or amlodipine, ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridines or excipient ingredients present in this combination.\rDuring pregnancy and for lactating women.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with perindopril and amlodipine given separately are: oedema, somnolence, dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of the treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual impairment (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, flushing, hypotension (and effects related to hypotension), dyspnoea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change of bowel habit, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritus, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue, asthenia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThis combination should not be initiated during pregnancy and lactation. Patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with this combination should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative treatment should be started.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs Coveram contains lactose monohydrate, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption, or total lactase deficiency should not take Coveram.\r Since ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation resulting in decreased production of aldosterone, increases in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors including perindopril. Serum electrolytes (including sodium potassium and urea) should be measured from time to time when ACE inhibitors are given especially in combination with diuretics.\rUse in Special Populations\rPaediatric use: Use of Coveram in children is not recommended as no data establishing safety or effectiveness in children are available.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a dry place below 25\u2070C. Keep the container tightly closed and protect from light.\r\nIndications\r\nCoveram is indicated as substitution therapy for the treatment of hypertension and/or stable coronary heart disease in patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril and amlodipine, given concurrently at the same dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with Coveram.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPerindopril, a pro-drug, is hydrolyzed to perindoprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor, which stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with an increase in serum potassium \r\n \nAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nperindopril arginine & amlodipine is as substitution therapy for patients already controlled with separate doses of perindopril (5 or 10 mg) and amlodipine (5 or 10 mg), given concurrently at the dose level. Treatment should not be initiated with this combination.\r\n \nFood intake may reduce hepatic biotransformation of perindopril to perindoprilat. Recommended treatment is one tablet per day as a single dose, preferably to be taken in the morning and before a meal. As perindopril and amlodipine may be used for different clinical indications, dose adjustments should be based on clinical judgment and the individual patient profile.\r\n \nAdjustments can be made by decreasing or increasing the dose of either perindopril and/or amlodipine using separate perindopril and/or amlodipine products within the recommended dose range until clinical stability is re-established. Consult the Product Information of the individual perindopril and/or amlodipine products being used when adjusting the dose.\r\n \nIn the event that down-titration is required, adjustments using amlodipine 2.5 mg or a dose of perindopril equivalent to perindopril arginine 2.5 mg, as separate products should be considered until clinical stability is re-established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nBaclofen may increase the antihypertensive effect of Coveram. Monitor blood pressure and renal function, and adjust the dose of Coveram if necessary. Combined use of these medicines may increase the hypotensive effects of perindopril and amlodipine. Combined use with nitroglycerine and other nitrates or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood pressure and therefore should be considered with caution.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis combination is contraindicated:\r\nIn patients with a history of previous hypersensitivity to either of the active ingredients; perindopril or amlodipine, ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridines or excipient ingredients present in this combination.\r\nDuring pregnancy and for lactating women.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions with perindopril and amlodipine given separately are: oedema, somnolence, dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of the treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual impairment (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, flushing, hypotension (and effects related to hypotension), dyspnoea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change of bowel habit, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritus, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue, asthenia.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis combination should not be initiated during pregnancy and lactation.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\r\nCo-administration with aliskiren with Mitosan: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Mitosan tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r\n \nFor patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Mitosan tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Mitosan Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised before taking Mitosan Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Mitosan Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Mitosan Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Mitosan Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Cardipin and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Cardipin and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Cardipin and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Cardipin did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Cardipin.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Cardipin may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Cardipin used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Cardipin is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Cardipin have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Cardipin should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children. Store in a cool & dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nEssential hypertension: Cardipin is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\n \nAngina pectoris: Cardipin is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoren is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rBisoren is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisoren fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisoren fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoren in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisoren fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisoren fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoren in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

        "description": "Indications\rAzisan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily stroke and myocardial infarction. Azisan may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with efects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting efects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater afnity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not afect bradykinin levels. Whether this diference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the efect of azilsartan on blood pressure.\r Azilsartan inhibits the pressor efects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor efect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of Azilsartan to healthy subjects; no clinically signifcant efects on serum potassium or sodium were observed.\r Absorption: Azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not afect the bioavailability of azilsartan.\r Distribution: The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus.\r Metabolism and Elimination: Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Azilsartan. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a Starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics. If blood pressure is not controlled with Azilsartan alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Azilsartan with other antihypertensive agents.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo drug interactions have been observed in studies of Azisan or Azisan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlorthalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, pioglitazone and warfarin. The antihypertensive effect of Azisan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated to co-administer Aliskiren with Azilsartan in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. The other side effects are nausea, asthenia, fatigue, muscle spasm, dizziness and cough.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Azilsartan Medoxomil is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Azilsartan Medoxomil is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Azisan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Changes in renal function including renal failure has been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to azilsartan. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal function. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: No dose adjustment with Azisan is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total patients in clinical studies with Azisan, 26% were elderly (65 years of age and older); 5% were 75 years of age and older. Abnormally high serum creatinine values were more likely to be reported for patients age 75 year or older. No other differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients, but the greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\r Renal Impairment: Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild-to-severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment are more likely to report abnormally high serum creatinine values.\r Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Azisan has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rLimited data are available related to overdose in humans. In the event of and overdose, supportive therapy should be instituted as dictated by the patient\u2019s clinical status. Azisan is not dialyzable.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAzisan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily stroke and myocardial infarction. Azisan may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with efects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting efects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater afnity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r\n \nBlockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not afect bradykinin levels. Whether this diference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the efect of azilsartan on blood pressure.\r\n \nAzilsartan inhibits the pressor efects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor efect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of Azilsartan to healthy subjects; no clinically signifcant efects on serum potassium or sodium were observed.\r\n \nAbsorption: Azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not afect the bioavailability of azilsartan.\r\n \nDistribution: The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Azilsartan. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a Starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics. If blood pressure is not controlled with Azilsartan alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Azilsartan with other antihypertensive agents.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo drug interactions have been observed in studies of Azisan or Azisan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlorthalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, ketoconazole, metformin, pioglitazone and warfarin. The antihypertensive effect of Azisan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated to co-administer Aliskiren with Azilsartan in patients with Diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. The other side effects are nausea, asthenia, fatigue, muscle spasm, dizziness and cough.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Azilsartan Medoxomil is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Azilsartan Medoxomil is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse of Azisan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Changes in renal function including renal failure has been reported in renal impaired patient.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to azilsartan. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal function. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: No dose adjustment with Azisan is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total patients in clinical studies with Azisan, 26% were elderly (65 years of age and older); 5% were 75 years of age and older. Abnormally high serum creatinine values were more likely to be reported for patients age 75 year or older. No other differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients, but the greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild-to-severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Alphapress XR is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Alphapress XR can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress XR is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Alphapress XR may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Alphapress XR indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress XR is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlphapress XR XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Alphapress XR therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Alphapress XR therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Alphapress XR, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Alphapress XR when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Alphapress XR. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Alphapress XR XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Alphapress XR therapy.\r Left Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphapress XR has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Alphapress XR will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Alphapress XR is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress XR is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Alphapress XR in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress XR is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C.

Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r\n \nThe addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nAlphapress XR XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\r\nCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\r\nHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\r\ntranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\r\nantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\r\nanalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\r\nContraindications\r\nPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common reactions associated with Alphapress XR therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Alphapress XR therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Alphapress XR, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Alphapress XR when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Alphapress XR. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Alphapress XR XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Alphapress XR therapy.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphapress XR has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Alphapress XR will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nChildren: Alphapress XR is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: Alphapress XR is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Alphapress XR in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress XR is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Alphapress XR is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Alphapress XR can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress XR is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Alphapress XR may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Alphapress XR indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress XR is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlphapress XR XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Alphapress XR therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea.

In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Alphapress XR therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Alphapress XR, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Alphapress XR when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Alphapress XR. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Alphapress XR XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Alphapress XR therapy.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphapress XR has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Alphapress XR will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress XR decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Alphapress XR is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nChildren: Alphapress XR is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: Alphapress XR is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Alphapress XR in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress XR is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.",

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Alphapress is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Alphapress can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Alphapress may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Alphapress indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlphapress XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Alphapress therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea.

In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Alphapress therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Alphapress, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Alphapress when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Alphapress. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Alphapress XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Alphapress therapy.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphapress has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Alphapress will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r\n \nRaynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Alphapress decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Alphapress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r\n \nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Alphapress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nChildren: Alphapress is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r\n \nLeft Ventricular Failure: Alphapress is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Alphapress in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C. Keep away from reach out of the children.",

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bislol fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bislol fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bislol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBislol Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bislol Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bislol Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Bislol Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bislol Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Bislol Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg.

        "description": "Indications\rDiovan is indicated:\rFor hypertension\rTo reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\rTo reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\rPharmacology\rValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage\rHypertension: The usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs within 4 weeks. \r Heart failure: The usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily. \r Post-Myocardial Infarction: The initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if tolerated without side effects.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40%, so it should be taken on an empty stomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo drug interactions of clinical significance have been found. Compounds which have been studied in clinical trials include Cimetidine, Warfarin, Furosemide, Digoxin, Atenolol, Indomethacin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine and Glibenclamide\r As Diovan is not metabolized to a significant extent, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in the form of metabolic induction or inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system are not expected with Diovan. Although Diovan is highly bound to plasma proteins, in vitrostudies have not shown any interaction at this level with a range of molecules which are also highly protein bound, such as Diclofenac, Furosemide, and Warfarin. Concomitant use of potassium sparing diuretics (e.g., Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride) potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. If co medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable\rContraindications\rValsartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rDiovan is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Diovan.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r Nursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Diovan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r Impaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of Diovan was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some elderly persons cannot be ruled out.\r Hepatic Impairment:\rMild to moderate: Max: 80 mg once daily.\rSevere: Contraindicated.\rOverdose Effects\rLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans.

Protect from moisture and heat.\r\nIndications\r\nDiovan is indicated:\r\nFor hypertension\r\nTo reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\r\nTo reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\r\nPharmacology\r\nValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\nDosage\r\nHypertension: The usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs within 4 weeks. \r\n \nHeart failure: The usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily. \r\n \nPost-Myocardial Infarction: The initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if tolerated without side effects.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40%, so it should be taken on an empty stomach.

It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled with Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, should switch to Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination once daily. Highest allowed dose of Valsartan should not be greater than 320 mg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. \r For Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\r Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rValsartan:\rDiuretics: Patient on diuretics may occasionally experience excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Valsartan. No drug interaction of clinical significance has been identified with thiazide diuretics. \rAgents increasing Serum Potassium: Since Valsartan decreases the production of aldosterone, potassium supplements or salt containing potassium substitutes may lead to hyperkalemia. \rLithium Salts: As with other drugs which eliminate sodium, lithium clearance may be reduced. Therefore, serum lithium levels should be monitored carefully if lithium salts are to be administered.\rOther drugs showing interaction are Warfarin, Digoxin.\rHydrochlorothiazide:\rWhen administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate antihypertensive effect or orthostatic hypotension may occur.\rAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\rOther antihypertensive drugs give additive effect.\rCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.\rContraindications\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare.

        "description": "Indications\rCo-Diovan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled with Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, should switch to Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination once daily. Highest allowed dose of Valsartan should not be greater than 320 mg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. \r For Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\r Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rValsartan:\rDiuretics: Patient on diuretics may occasionally experience excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Valsartan. No drug interaction of clinical significance has been identified with thiazide diuretics. \rAgents increasing Serum Potassium: Since Valsartan decreases the production of aldosterone, potassium supplements or salt containing potassium substitutes may lead to hyperkalemia. \rLithium Salts: As with other drugs which eliminate sodium, lithium clearance may be reduced. Therefore, serum lithium levels should be monitored carefully if lithium salts are to be administered.\rOther drugs showing interaction are Warfarin, Digoxin.\rHydrochlorothiazide:\rWhen administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate antihypertensive effect or orthostatic hypotension may occur.\rAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\rOther antihypertensive drugs give additive effect.\rCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.\rContraindications\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r Nursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Valsartan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder. \r Impaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment because thiazides may precipitate azotemia. \r Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with Co-Diovan may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Losarva is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r Renal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Losarva is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\rPharmacology\rLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losarva. Concomitant use of Losarva and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Losarva are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Losarva during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losarva is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losarva is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Losarva should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Losarva is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r\n \nRenal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Losarva is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\r\nPharmacology\r\nLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r\n \nPatients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r\n \nPatients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losarva. Concomitant use of Losarva and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\r\nContraindications\r\nLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe side effects with the use of Losarva are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse of Losarva during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losarva is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r\n \nUse in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment.

        "description": "Indications\rLosarva Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rBisopress is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rBisopress is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisopress fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisopress fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisopress fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Bisopress fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats.

Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisopress in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The tablets are designed for sustained release of the drug in the intestine.\rPharmacology\rVerapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker with antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and antihypertensive activity. Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily, but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing. As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.\rDosage & Administration\rVerapamil Tablet:\rThe dose of Verapamil should be individualized by titration and the drug should be administered with food.\rFor essential hypertension the initial dose should be given 180 mg in the morning. If adequate response is not obtained with 180 mg of Verapamil then the dose may be titrated by following manner: 240 mg each morning. 180 mg each morning plus 180 mg each evening. 240 mg every 12 hourly.\rFor angina the usual dose is 80 mg to 120 mg three times a day.\rFor arrythmias in digitalized patients, Verapamil should be given 240 mg to 360 mg in divided doses, depending on the severity of the condition. Divided doses up to 180 mg/day may occasionally be needed.\rVerapamil Injection:\rAdults: 5 mg slowly intravenously, in tachycardias and hypertensive crises, if necessary repeat after 5 to 10 minutes. Drip infusion to maintain the therapeutic effect: 5-10 mg/hour in physiological saline, glucose, laevulose or similar solutions, on average up to a total dose of 100 mg/day. \r Children:\rNewborn: 0.75-1 mg (0.3-0.4 ml)\rInfants: 0.75-2 mg (0.3-0.8 ml)\rChildren age 1-5 years: 2-3 mg (0.8-1.2 ml)\rAge 6-14 years: 2.5-5 mg (1-2 ml)\rof Verapamil, given intravenously, depending on age and action. The injection should be made slowly under electrocardiographic control and only until onset of the effect. Intravenous infusion in hypertensive crises: initially 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/hour; if the effect proves to be insufficient, the dose is increased at 30-60 minute intervals until twice the dose or more is reached. Average total dose up to 1.5 mg/kg/day.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rMay increase plasma level with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ritonavir), cimetidine. May decrease plasma level with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin), phenobarbital, sulfinpyrazone. Increased risk of bleeding with aspirin. May increase bradycardic and hypotensive effect with telithromycin. Increased AV blocking effect with clonidine. May increase plasma level of cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin, digitoxin), \u03b2-blockers (e.g. propranolol, metoprolol), \u03b1-blockers (e.g. terazosin, prazosin), immunosuppressants (e.g. sirolimus, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus), lipid lowering agents (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin), colchicines, quinidine, carbamazepine, imipramine, glibenclamide, doxorubicin, midazolam, buspirone, almotriptan, theophylline. May potentiate hypotensive effect with diuretics, antihypertensives, vasodilators. May increase neurotoxic effect of lithium.\rContraindications\rSevere left ventricular dysfunction\rHypotension or cardiogenic shock\rSick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)\rSecond or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker)\rPatients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory by pass tract (eg. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome)\rPatients with known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochloride\rSide Effects\rVeracal is generally well tolerated. The following reaction to orally administered Veracal appeared clearly drug-related or occurred at rates greater than 1% in clinical trials with approximately 5000 patients.\rDigestive system: Constipation, nausea;\rCardiovascular system: Hypotension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, AV block;\rRespiratory system: Upper respiratory tract infections;\rNervous system: Dizziness, headache, fatigue;\rSkin: Rash, flashing;\rHepatic: Elevated liver enzyme.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, so this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and can be detected in umbilical vein blood during delivery. Verapamil is excreted in breast milk. So nursing should be discontinued while Verapamil is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken in 1st degree AV block, bradycardia <50 beats/minutes, hypotension <90 mm Hg systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation/flutter and simultaneous pre-excitation syndrome e.g. WPW syndrome, heart failure (previous compensation with cardiac glycosides/diuretics required). Veracal may impair ability to drive or operate machinery, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and with concomitant consumption of alcohol. Veracal markedly slows down the elimination of alcohol and prolongs the duration of the effects of alcohol.\rOverdose Effects\rTreatment of overdose should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solution may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used in the treatment of overdose with Veracal. Veracal cannot be removed by hemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

Drip\rinfusion to maintain the therapeutic effect: 5-10 mg/hour in physiological saline, glucose, laevulose or similar solutions, on\raverage up to a total dose of 100mg/day.\r Children:\r Newborn 0.75-1mg (= 0.3-0.4ml)\rInfants 0.75-2mg (= 0.3-0.8ml)\rChildren age 1-5 years: 2-3mg (= 0.8-1.2ml)\rage 6-14 years: 2.5-5mg (= 1-2ml)\r of Verapamil, given intravenously, depending on age and action. The injection should be made slowly under electrocardiographic\rcontrol and only until onset of the effect. Intravenous infusion in hypertensive crises: initially 0.05-0.1mg/kg/hour; if the\reffect proves to be insufficient, the dose is increased at 30-60 minute intervals until twice the dose or more is reached. Average\rtotal dose up to 1.5mg/kg/day.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r Verapamil is generally well tolerated. The following reaction to orally administered Verapamil appeared clearly drug related or\roccurred at rates greater than 1% in clinical trials with approximately 5000 patients.\rDigestive system: Constipation, nausea;\rCardiovascular system: Hypotension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, AV block;\rRespiratory system: Upper respiratory tract infections;\rNervous system: Dizziness, headache, fatigue;\rSkin: Rash, flashing;\rHepatic: Elevated liver enzyme.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Care should be taken in 1st degree AV block, bradycardia <50 beats/minutes, hypotension <90 mm Hg systolic pressure, atrial\rfibrillation/flutter and simultaneous pre-excitation syndrome e.g. WPW syndrome, heart failure (previous compensation with cardiac\rglycosides/diuretics required).\rVerapamil may impair ability to drive or operate machinery, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and with concomitant\rconsumption of alcohol. Verapamil markedly slows down the elimination of alcohol and prolongs the duration of the effects of\ralcohol.\rVerapamil should be given as a slow intravenous injection over at least 2 minutes under continuous ECG and blood pressure\rmonitoring. Intravenous injection should only be given by the physician.\rIn atrial fibrillation and simultaneous WPW syndrome there is a risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Verapamil carries the potential to produce fetal hypoxia associated with maternal hypotension. Verapamil should not be\radministered intravenously during the first six months of pregnancy. There are no data on use in the first and second trimester.\rVerapamil should not be used in the final trimester unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Verapamil should not be\radministered intravenously during lactation. If a nursing mother requires intravenous Verapamil, breast feeding should be\rdiscontinued for the duration of treatment.\r  OVER DOSE\r Treatment of overdose should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solution may\rincrease calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used in the treatment of overdose with Verapamil. Verapamil cannot\rbe removed by haemodialysis.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Veracal 40: Each box contains 5 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rVeracal 80: Each box contains 5 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rVeracal SR: Each box contains 3 blister strips of 10 sustained release tablets.\rVeracal SR 180: Each box contains 3 blister strips of 10 sustained release tablets.\rVeracal Injection : Each box contains 5 ampoules of 2ml injection.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nVeracal 40: Each tablet contains Verapamil Hydrochloride USP 40 mg.\r\n \nVeracal 80: Each tablet contains Verapamil Hydrochloride USP 80 mg.\r\n \nVeracal SR: Each sustained release tablet contains Verapamil Hydrochloride USP 240 mg.\r\n \nVeracal SR 180: Each sustained release tablet contains Verapamil Hydrochloride USP 180 mg.\r\n \nVeracal Injection: Each 2 ml of injection solution contains 5 mg of Verapamil hydrochloride USP.\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nVerapamil has a pronounced antiarrhythmic action particularly in supraventricular cardiac arrhythmias. It prolongs impulse\r\nconduction in the AV node and thereby depending on the type of arrhythmia restores the sinus rhythm and / or normalizes the\r\nventricular rate. The calcium antagonist Verapamil reduces myocardial oxygen consumption directly by intervening in the energy\r\nconsuming metabolic processes of the myocardial cell and indirectly by diminishing the peripheral resistance ( afterload ). The\r\ndecrease of the vascular smooth muscle tone moreover prevents coronary spasms and lowers raised blood pressure.\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nVeracal Tablet:\r\n \n- Essential hypertension\r\n \n- Angina pectoris and prevention of re-infarction\r\n \n- Supraventricular arrhythmias\r\n \nVeracal Injection:\r\n \n- Tachycardias such as:\r\n \nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardias\r\n \n- Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (except WPWS)\r\n \n- Atrial flutter with rapid conduction\r\n \n- Extrasystoles\r\n \n- Acute hypertension\r\n \n- Acute coronary insufficiency\r\n \nFor the prophylaxis and / or therapy of ectopic arrhythmias (predominantly ventricular extrasystoles) in halothane anaesthesia and\r\nin the application of adrenaline in halothane anaesthesia respectively.\r\n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \nVeracal Tablet\r\nThe dose of Verapamil should be individualized by titration and the drug should be administered with food.\r\nFor essential hypertension the initial dose should be given 180 mg in the morning.

It is orally active\rand specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood\rvessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II\rreceptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting\rpulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not\rbind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r  INDICATIONS\r Valsartan is indicated:\r For hypertension\r To reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\r To reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Hypertension:\rThe usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs\rwithin 4 weeks.\rHeart failure:\rThe usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily.\rPost-Myocardial Infarction:\rThe initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if\rtolerated without side effects.\rAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40 %, so it should be taken on an empty\rstomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rGeriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety without some exception.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Valsartan is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness,\rfatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function,\rallergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also\roccur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Valsartan.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Impaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Valsartan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild\rto moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\rImpaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\rHeart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and\rpost-myocardial infarction patients.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus.\rWhen pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\rNursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the\rnursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the\rimportance of the drug to the mother.\r  OVER DOSE\r Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and\rtachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should\rbe placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Valsartil 40 : Each box contains 3 alu-alu blister strips of 10 tablets.\rValsartil 80 : Each box contains 3 alu-alu blister strips of 10 tablets.\rValsartil 160 : Each box contains 3 alu-alu blister strips of 10 tablets.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nValsartil 40 : Each tablet contains Valsartan USP 40 mg.\r\n \nValsartil 80 : Each tablet contains Valsartan USP 80 mg.\r\n \nValsartil 160 : Each tablet contains Valsartan USP 160 mg.\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

It does not\r\nbind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nValsartan is indicated:\r\n \nFor hypertension\r\n \nTo reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\r\n \nTo reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\r\n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \nHypertension:\r\nThe usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs\r\nwithin 4 weeks.\r\nHeart failure:\r\nThe usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily.\r\nPost-Myocardial Infarction:\r\nThe initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if\r\ntolerated without side effects.\r\nAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40 %, so it should be taken on an empty\r\nstomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nGeriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety without some exception.\r\n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nValsartan is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness,\r\nfatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function,\r\nallergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also\r\noccur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Valsartan.\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Valsartan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild\r\nto moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r\nImpaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r\nHeart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and\r\npost-myocardial infarction patients.\r\n \n \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r\n \nPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus.\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r\nNursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the\r\nnursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the\r\nimportance of the drug to the mother.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and\r\ntachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation.

Concomitant use of nitrates with tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may cause high blood pressure. Concomitant use of nitrates with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil cause fall in blood pressure. Aspirin decreases the clearance and enhances the hemodynamic effects of Trocer SR. Trocer SR may reduce the pharmacologic effects of heparin when used concomitantly. Nitrates increase the bioavailability of dihydroergotamine.\rContraindications\rNitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin, other organic nitrates, or nitrites or to the excipients of the medicine. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, marked anaemia, head trauma, cerebral haemorrhage, or closed angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rHeadache may occur at the onset of treatment but will usually subside after a few days. If the headache persists dosage should be decreased. Other side effects include tachycardia, postural hypotension and syncope, cyanosis and methaemoglobinaemia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is no evidence relating to the safety of nitrates in pregnancy and lactation. Nitroglycerin should be administered to pregnant women and nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTrocer SR should be used with caution in patients who are predisposed to closed-angle glaucoma. As with other drugs for the treatment of angina pectoris, abrupt discontinuation of therapy may lead to exacerbation of symptoms. When discontinuing long term treatment, the dosage should be reduced gradually over several days, and the patient carefully monitored. The use of Trocer SR during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to hemodynamic monitoring and clinical status to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.\rOverdose Effects\rln the case of overdosage, the likely symptomatology may be peripheral vasodilation with a fall in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. In such an event, monitoring of cardiac function and general supportive measures should be used. If not successful, circulating plasma volume should be increased by substitution of fluid. ln life-threatening situations, administration of vasopressors should be considered.\rTherapeutic Class\rNitrates: Coronary vasodilators\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place away from light and heat.

As with other drugs for the treatment of angina pectoris, abrupt discontinuation of therapy may lead to exacerbation of symptoms. When discontinuing long term treatment, the dosage should be reduced gradually over several days, and the patient carefully monitored. The use of Trocer SR during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to hemodynamic monitoring and clinical status to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nln the case of overdosage, the likely symptomatology may be peripheral vasodilation with a fall in blood pressure and reflex tachycardia. In such an event, monitoring of cardiac function and general supportive measures should be used. If not successful, circulating plasma volume should be increased by substitution of fluid. ln life-threatening situations, administration of vasopressors should be considered.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNitrates: Coronary vasodilators\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place away from light and heat. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telmipres Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised before taking Telmipres Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telmipres Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telmipres Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telmipres Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telmipres Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telmipres Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep out of the reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telmipres Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rSardopa is indicated in Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rMethyldopa, or \u03b1-methyldopa, is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent. It is an analog of DOPA (3,4\u2010hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(\u03b1)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals. Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-\u03b1-methyldopa and L-\u03b1-methyldopa, which is the active form.\r First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents; however, it is still used as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults-\rInitiation of Therapy: The usual starting dosage of Methyldopa is 250 mg two or three times a day in the first 48 hours. The daily dosage then may be increased or decreased, preferably at intervals of not less than two days, until an adequate response is achieved. To minimize the sedation, start dosage increases in the evening. When Methyldopa is given to patients on other antihypertensives, the dose of these agents may need to be adjusted to effect a smooth transition. When Methyldopa is given with antihypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of Methyldopa should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses; when Methyldopa is added to a thiazide, the dosage of thiazide need not to be changed.\rMaintenance Therapy: The usual daily dosage of Methyldopa is 500 mg to 2 g in two to four doses. Although occasional patients have responded to higher doses, the maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 gm. Occasionally tolerance may occur, usually between the second and third month of therapy. Adding a diuretic or increasing the dosage of Methyldopa frequently will restore effective control of blood pressure. A thiazide may be added at any time during Methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy'has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 gm of Methyldopa daily. Methyldopa is largely excreted by the kidney and patients with impaired renal function may respond to smaller doses. Syncope in older patients may be related to an increased sensitivity and advanced arteriosclerotic vascular disease. This may be avoided by lower doses.\rPediatric Use: Initial dosage is based on 10 mg/kg of body weight daily in two to four doses. The daily dosage then is increased or decreased until an adequate response is achieved. The maximum dosage is 65 mg/kg or 3 gm daily, whichever is less.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rWhen Sardopa is used with other antihypertensive drugs, potentiation of antihypertensive effect may occur. Patients may require reduced doses of anesthetics when on Sardopa. When Sardopa and lithium are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity. Coadministration of Sardopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended.\rContraindications\rMethyldopa is contraindicated in patients:\rwith active hepatic disease, such as acute hepatitis and active cirrhosis\rwith liver disorders previously associated with Methyldopa therapy\rwith hypersensitivity to any component of these products\ron therapy with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.\rSide Effects\rSedation, usually transient, may occur during the initial period of therapy or whenever the dose is increased. Headache, asthenia, or weakness may be noted as early and transient symptoms. The following systemic side effects may rarely occur with the use of Sardopa- angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, edema or weight gain, bradycardia, pancreatitis, colitis, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, dryness of mouth, hyperprolactinemia, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia; rheumatoid factor, hepatitis, jaundice, myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, eosinophilia, parkinsonism, bell's palsy, nightmares and reversible mild psychoses or depression, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesias, arthralgia, myalgia, nasal stuffiness, rash, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, lactation, impotence. However, significant adverse effects due to Sardopa have been infrequent and this agent usually is well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B. Methyldopa appears in breast milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when Methyldopa is given to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSardopa should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction. Some patients taking Sardopa experience clinical edema or weight gain, which may be controlled by use of a diuretic. Sardopa should not be continued if edema progresses or signs of heart failure appear. Hypertension has recurred occasionally after dialysis in patients given Sardopa because the drug is removed by this procedure. Rarely involuntary choreoathetotic movements have been observed during therapy with Sardopa in patients with severe bilateral cerebrovascular disease. If these movements occur, stop therapy\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: There are no well-controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Information on dosing in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from published literature regarding the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage may produce acute hypotension with other responses attributable to brain and gastrointestinal malfunction (excessive sedation, weakness, bradycardia, dizziness, lightheadedness, constipation, distention, flatus, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. When ingestion is recent, gastric lavage or emesis may reduce absorption. When ingestion has been earlier, infusions may be helpful to promote urinary excretion.\rTherapeutic Class\rCentrally acting antihypertensive drugs (central sympatholytic)\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

Hypertension has recurred occasionally after dialysis in patients given Sardopa because the drug is removed by this procedure. Rarely involuntary choreoathetotic movements have been observed during therapy with Sardopa in patients with severe bilateral cerebrovascular disease. If these movements occur, stop therapy\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: There are no well-controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. Information on dosing in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from published literature regarding the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAcute overdosage may produce acute hypotension with other responses attributable to brain and gastrointestinal malfunction (excessive sedation, weakness, bradycardia, dizziness, lightheadedness, constipation, distention, flatus, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. When ingestion is recent, gastric lavage or emesis may reduce absorption. When ingestion has been earlier, infusions may be helpful to promote urinary excretion.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCentrally acting antihypertensive drugs (central sympatholytic)\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\n.",

        "description": "Indications\rRamoril indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in renal impairment:\rFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\rFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramoril and cause deterioration of renal function.\rContraindications\rRamipril must not be used\rin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\rin patients with a history of angioedema.\rconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\rin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\rin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\rwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\rwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\rduring pregnancy.\rConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\rSide Effects\rRamoril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRamoril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramoril.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramoril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramoril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry.

In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\r\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\r\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\r\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\r\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRamoril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRamoril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramoril.\r\n \nRenal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramoril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r\n \nPatients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramoril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r\n \nManagement: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.",

        "description": "Indications\rRamoril indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r Prevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in renal impairment:\rFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\rFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid.

Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramoril and cause deterioration of renal function.\rContraindications\rRamipril must not be used\rin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\rin patients with a history of angioedema.\rconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy.

The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\nIndications\r\nRamoril indicated in the following cases:\r\nHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\r\nTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\r\nTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\r\nReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\r\nPharmacology\r\nRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\r\nDosage\r\nDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r\n \nHypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r\n \nCongestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r\n \nPrevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r\n \nDosage in renal impairment:\r\nFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily. Subsequent dosage should be titrated according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5 mg daily.\r\nFor patients with heart failure and renal impairment: The recommended dose is 1.25 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nAdministration\r\nRamipril tablets have to be swallowed with sufficient amounts of liquid. The tablets must not be chewed or crushed. Absorption of Ramipril is not significantly affected by food. Ramipril may, therefore, be taken before, during or after a meal.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramoril and cause deterioration of renal function.\r\nContraindications\r\nRamipril must not be used\r\nin patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or any of the excipients of Ramipril.\r\nin patients with a history of angioedema.\r\nconcomitantly with sacubitril/valsartan therapy. Do not initiate Ramipril until sacubitril/valsartan is eliminated from the body. In case of switch from Ramipril to sacubitril/valsartan, do not start sacubitril/valsartan until Ramipril is eliminated from the body.\r\nin patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney.\r\nin patients with hypotensive or haemodynamically unstable states.\r\nwith aliskiren-containing medicines in patients with diabetes or with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min).\r\nwith angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided, since such use may lead to severe anaphylactoid reactions. Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRamoril is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRamoril should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramoril.\r\n \nRenal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramoril. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramoril. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramoril daily must be considered.\r\n \nPatients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramoril, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in patients (in whom combination therapy is appropriate) who have been stabilised on the individual components given in the same proportion.\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rDose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect. A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with ramipril (or another ACE inhibitor) alone or with hydrochlorothiazide (or another thiazide diuretic) alone may be switched to combination therapy with Ramipril 2.5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or Ramipril 5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablet.\r Replacement Therapy: For convenience, patients receiving ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of combination of Ramipril 2.5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or Ramipril 5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. If necessary, the dose may be increased to two tablets of Ramipril 2.5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or Ramipril 5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.\r Maximum daily dose: 10 mg ramipril and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide (four tablets of Ramipril 2.5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or two tablets of Ramipril 5 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg).\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCombination with diuretics or other antihypertensive agents or nitrates and tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the antihypertensive response to Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination. Patients previously treated with diuretics may experience a marked drop in blood pressure. Ramipril / Hydrochlorothiazide may weaken the effectiveness of blood sugar lowering medications (antidiabetic agents, e.g. insulin and sulphonylurea derivatives). When Ramipril/Hydrochlorothiazide is administered simultaneously with acetyl salicylic acid or indomethacin, attenuation of antihypertensive effect and moreover acute renal failure may occur. Ramipril / Hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the effects of alcohol.\rContraindications\rThis preparation must not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide or other thiazide diuretics. History of hereditary angioneurotic oedema. Severe impairment of renal function. Haemodynamically relevant unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and in patients with low blood pressure (hypotensive patients) or in patients with an unstable circulatory situation (haemodynamically unstable patients) where there might be a risk of life-threatening fall in blood pressure and renal failure. Clinically relevant electrolyte disturbances e.g. hypokalemia, hyponatremia or hypercalcemia which may worsen following treatment.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated. Side effects commonly reported include headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, cough, weakness, diarrhoea, fever, gastric irritation, pulmonary oedema, photosensitivity, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia and vertigo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rACE inhibitors can cause foetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Also, thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of foetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. When pregnancy is detected, Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination should be discontinued as soon as possible. This product is excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women receiving Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination should not breast feed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTreatment with Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination requires regular medical supervision. Generally dehydration, reduced blood volume (hypovolumia) or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating the treatment (in patients with concomitant heart failure, however, this must be carefully weighed against the risk of volume overload).\r Special caution is necessary during the treatment of: Patients with severe and particularly with malignant hypertension. Patients with concomitant and particularly with severe heart failure. Patients in whom fluid or salt deficiency exists or may develop (as a result of inadequate fluid or salt intake) or as a result of diarrhoea, vomiting or excessive sweating in cases where salt and fluid replacement is inadequate. Patients with haemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis. In patients with pre-existing impairment of renal function or in kidney transplant patients. White blood cell count should be monitored (more frequent in the initial phase of the treatment) so that leucopenia can be detected. Insufficient experience has been gained concerning the use of Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide combination in children.\rUse in Special Populations\rDosage in renal impairment: In patients with a creatinine clearance between 60 and 30 ml/min, treatment should be initiated with Ramipril 1.25 mg monotherapy. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the dose of Ramipril may be increased to 2.5 mg. If blood pressure is still not controlled, patient may be switched to one tablet of Ramoril 2.5 Plus once daily. Dosage may be titrated upward to Ramoril 5 Plus until blood pressure is controlled.\r Uue in children: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established\rOverdose Effects\rRamipril: Limited data on human overdosage are available. The most likely clinical manifestations would be symptoms attributable to hypotension. Because the hypotensive effect of Ramipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat Ramipril overdosage by infusion of normal saline solution.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in patients (in whom combination therapy is appropriate) who have been stabilised on the individual components given in the same proportion.\r\nPharmacology\r\nRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II.

        "description": "Indications\rPixorel is a factor Xa inhibitor indicated:\rTo reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation\rFor the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery\rFor the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rPharmacology\rApixaban acts by inhibiting coagulation, and thus prevents development of blood clots. As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.\rDosage & Administration\rRecommended Dose: The recommended dose of Apixaban for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.\r Dosage Adjustments: The recommended dose of Apixaban is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with any 2 of the following characteristics: age \u226580 years, body weight \u226460 kg, serum creatinine \u22651.5mg/dl.\r CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors: When Apixaban is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.\r Missed Dose: If a dose of Apixaban is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.\r Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions: Apixaban should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled.\r Switching from or to Apixaban: Switching from warfarin to Apixaban: Warfarin should be discontinued and Apixaban started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.\r Switching from Apixaban to warfarin: Apixaban affects INR, so that INR measurements during co-administration with warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. If continuous anticoagulation is necessary, discontinue Apixaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of Apixaban would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.\r Switching between Apixaban and anticoagulants other than warfarin: Discontinue one being taken and begin the other at the next scheduled dose.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rPixorel is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp.

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstriction and aldosterono secreting effects of angiotensin 11 by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin 11 to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues. Osartil is now regarded as the first-line therapy option for treating high blood pressure.\r Indications\r Losartan is indicated for the treatment of all grades of hypertension, Chronic heart failure, Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH and Nephropathy in type 2 Diabetes. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is an alternative for patients who have to discontinue an ACE inhibitor because of persistent dry cough.\r Dosage and Administration\r Hypertension: The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily. In patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or patients with a history of hepatic impairment, starting dose is 25 mg once daily. Losartan can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly or renal impairment patients. If blood pressure is not controlled by Losartan, a low dose of a diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide) may be added. Losartan may be administered with or without food. Chronic heart failure: 12.5 mg once daily, increased at weekly intervals to 50 mg once daily it tolerated. Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH: 50 mg once daily.

Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstriction and aldosterono secreting effects of angiotensin 11 by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin 11 to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues. Osartil is now regarded as the first-line therapy option for treating high blood pressure.\r\n \nIndications\r\n \nLosartan is indicated for the treatment of all grades of hypertension, Chronic heart failure, Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH and Nephropathy in type 2 Diabetes. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is an alternative for patients who have to discontinue an ACE inhibitor because of persistent dry cough.\r\n \nDosage and Administration\r\n \nHypertension: The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily. In patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or patients with a history of hepatic impairment, starting dose is 25 mg once daily. Losartan can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly or renal impairment patients. If blood pressure is not controlled by Losartan, a low dose of a diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide) may be added. Losartan may be administered with or without food. Chronic heart failure: 12.5 mg once daily, increased at weekly intervals to 50 mg once daily it tolerated. Stroke risk reduction in hypertension & LVH: 50 mg once daily. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily should Maximum dose-Losartan 100 mg followed by Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily. Nephropathy in type 2 Diabetes: 50 mg once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rOsartil Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor.

        "description": "Indications\rBisopro is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rBisopro is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisopro fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bisopro fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisopro in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bisopro fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Bisopro fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisopro in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision\r\nshould be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the\r\nmother.\r\nUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C.\r\nGeriatric Use: No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other\r\nreported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater\r\nsensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\r\n \n \nDRUG INTERACTION\r\n \nBisoprolol should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs should be\r\nclosely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic\r\nactivity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that\r\nBisoprolol be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Bisoprolol should be used with care when\r\nmyocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists or antiarrhythmic agents are used\r\nconcurrently. Concomitant use with digitalis glycosides can increase the risk of bradycardia. Concurrent use of rifampin increases\r\nthe metabolic clearance of Bisoprolol, resulting in a shortened elimination half-life of Bisoprolol. However, initial dose\r\nmodification is generally not necessary.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nThere are limited data on overdose with bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide. The most frequently observed signs expected\r\nwith overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common, and with severe overdoses, delirium,\r\ncoma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia\r\nmay occur.\r\n \n \nSTORAGE\r\n \nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nBisopro 2.5 Plus : Each box contain 3 blister strips of 10 tablet.\r\nBisopro 5 Plus : Each box contain 3 blister strips of 10 tablet.",

Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells.\rAmlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral\rvascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Valsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active\rand specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors causes the blood\rvessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II\rreceptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting\rpulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesta is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesta was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesta is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesta, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesta and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesta may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmesta has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesta was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesta and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesta and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesta and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesta, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesta (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesta. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesta.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesta. The most likely effects of Olmesta overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesta requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesta was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesta is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesta, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesta and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesta may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmesta has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesta was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesta and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesta and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesta and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesta, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesta (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesta. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesta.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesta. The most likely effects of Olmesta overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesta requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rCardoPlus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nCardoPlus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\r\nDosage\r\nHypertension-\r\nThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\r\nFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\r\nA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\r\nIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\r\nIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\r\nNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\r\nSevere Hypertension:\r\nThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\r\nFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rCardobis is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rCardobis is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Cardobis fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Cardobis fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Cardobis in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Cardobis in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Cardobis fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine.

        "description": "Indications\rRamicard indicated in the following cases:\rHypertension; to lower blood pressure, as single-drug therapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rCongestive heart failure; also in combination with diuretics.\rTreatment of patients who- within the first few days after an acute myocardial infarction- have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure.\rTreatment of non-diabetic or diabetic overt glomerular or incipient nephropathy.\rReduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, such as manifest coronary heart disease (with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, a history of peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, smoking).\rPharmacology\rRamipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\rDosage\rDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r Hypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily.

Such extracorporeal treatments include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-fux (e.g. polyacrylonitril) membranes and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\rSide Effects\rRamicard is generally well tolerated. Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRamicard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Hepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramicard.\r Renal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramicard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r Patients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramicard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard.\rOverdose Effects\rSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r Management: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\rStorage Conditions\rStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry.

So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is also effective in the management of heart failure and reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.\r\nDosage\r\nDosage of Ramipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.\r\n \nHypertension: For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose of Ramipril is 1.25-2.5 mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2 week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20 mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.\r\n \nCongestive heart failure after myocardial infarction: In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25 mg twice daily. Therapy is then titrated to a target daily dose of 5 mg twice daily.\r\n \nPrevention of major cardiovascular events: In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg once daily for the first week of therapy and 5 mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg once daily.\r\n \nDosage in renal impairment:\r\nFor patients with hypertension and renal impairment: The recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg Ramipril once daily.

Dizziness, headache, fatigue and asthenia are commonly reported side effects. Other side effects occurring less frequently include symptomatic hypotension, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, urticaria, oliguria, anxiety, amnesia etc. Angioneurotic oedema, anaphylactic reactions and hyperkalaemia have also been reported rarely.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nRamipril must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided in cases where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable. If the patient intends to become pregnant, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued, i.e. replaced by another form of treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, medication with Ramipril must be replaced as soon as possible by a treatment regimen without ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Ramipril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRamicard should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and impaired hepatic function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly: A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Treatment in these patients must therefore be initiated only under close medical supervision. The maximum permitted daily dose in such cases is 2.5 mg Ramicard.\r\n \nRenal impairment: With a creatinine clearance between 50 and 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, the initial daily dose is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard. The maximum permitted daily dose, in this case, is 5 mg Ramicard. Patients with incompletely corrected fuid or salt depletion, in patients with severe hypertension, as well as in patients in whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk, (e.g., with relevant stenoses of the coronary vessels or those supplying the brain) A reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg Ramicard daily must be considered.\r\n \nPatients pretreated with a diuretic: Consideration must be given to discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days or- depending on the duration of action of the diuretic- longer before starting treatment with Ramicard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial daily dose in patients previously treated with a diuretic is generally 1.25 mg Ramicard.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSign and symptom: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure.\r\n \nManagement: Primary detoxifcation by, for example, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents, sodium sulfate; (if possible during the frst 30 minutes). In the event of hypotension administration of \u03b11-adrenergic agonists (e.g. norepinephrine, dopamine) or angiotensin II (angiotensinamide), which is usually available only in scattered research laboratories, must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at 30\u00b0 or below, protect from light. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not use later than the date of expiry. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.",

        "description": "Indications\rProstam Hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of functional symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).\rPharmacology\rTamsulosin, a selective alpha1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits its selectivity for alpha1 A adrenoceptors in human prostate. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH. Absorption of Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule 0.4mg is essentially complete (90%) following oral administration under fasting conditions. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) is reached by four to five hours under fasting conditions and by six to seven hours when administered with food. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extremely bound to human plasma protein (94% to 99%). Tamsulosin hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P 450 enzymes in the liver and less than 10% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged form. Following intravenous or oral administration of an immediate-release formulation the elimination half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride in plasma ranges from five to seven hours. Because of the absorption rate controlled pharmacokinetics with Prostam capsules, the apparent half-life of Tamsulosin hydrochloride is approximately 9 to 13 hours in healthy volunteers and 14 to 15 hours in the target population.\rDosage & Administration\rTamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.4 mg (one capsule) daily, to be taken after meal at night. The dose may be increased after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary, to Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.8 mg (two capsules) once daily. If Tamsulosin Hydrochloride administration is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either the 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg dose, therapy should be started again with the Tamsulosin Hydrochloride 0.4 mg (one capsule) once daily dose. The capsule should be swallowed whole with a glass of water (about 150 ml) in the standing or sitting position. The capsule should not be crunched or chewed, as this will interfere with the modified release of the active ingredient.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcurrent administration of other alfa1-adrenoceptor antagonists could lead to hypotensive effects. No interactions have been seen when Prostam was given concomitantly with either atenolol, enalapril or nifedipine. Concomitant cimetidine brings about a rise and frusemide a fall in plasma levels of Prostam, but as levels remain within the normal range posology need not be changed. No interactions at the level of hepatic metabolism have been seen during in vitro studies with liver microsomal fractions (representative of the cytochrome P450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system), involving amitriptyline, salbutamol, glibenclamide, and finasteride. Diclofenac and warfarin, however, may increase the elimination rate of Prostam.\rContraindications\rTamsulosin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it; history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency.\r As with other alpha1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur in individual cases during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur, at the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. And they should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result (like driving, operating machinery or performing hazardous tasks).\r Before therapy with Tamsulosin is initiated the patient should be examined in order to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as Benign Prostatic hyperplasia. Digital rectal examination and when the necessary determination of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards.\rSide Effects\rThe following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Prostam: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation and; less frequently headache, asthenia, postural hypotension and palpitations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse of Tamsulosin in pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRarely, transient postural symptoms have occurred during orthostatic provocation testing after the first dose. Use in patients with micturition syncope is not advised.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: No data is available on whether Prostam adversely affects the ability to drive or operate machines. However, in this respect, patients should be aware of the fact that dizziness can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rNo case of acute overdosage has been reported. However, acute hypotension is likely to occur after overdosage in which case cardiovascular support should be given. Blood pressure can be restored and the heart rate brought back to normal by lying the patient down. If this does not help then volume expanders, and when necessary, vasopressors could be employed. Renal function should be monitored and general supportive measures applied. Dialysis is unlikely to be of help as Prostam is very highly bound to plasma proteins. Measures, such as emesis, can be taken to impede absorption. When large quantities are involved, gastric lavage can be applied and activated charcoal and an osmotic laxative, such as sodium sulphate, can be administered.\rTherapeutic Class\rBPH/ Urinary retention/ Urinary incontinence\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, below 30\u00b0C, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nProstam Hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of functional symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).\r\nPharmacology\r\nTamsulosin, a selective alpha1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits its selectivity for alpha1 A adrenoceptors in human prostate.

Concomitant use of nitrates with tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol may cause high blood pressure. Concomitant use of nitrates with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil cause fall in blood pressure.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Losardil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r Renal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Losardil is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\rPharmacology\rLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losardil. Concomitant use of Losardil and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Losardil are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Losardil during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losardil is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losardil is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Losardil should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\r\nContraindications\r\nLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe side effects with the use of Losardil are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse of Losardil during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losardil is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r\n \nUse in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losardil is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Losardil should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. Cardiac arrhythmias, especially supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Adjunct to the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Early intervention with Betaloc-XR in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Pain relief may also decrease the need for opiate analgesics. Betaloc-XR has been shown to reduce mortality when administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction.\rPharmacology\rMetoprolol is a selective beta1-blocker. Metoprolol reduces or inhibits the agonistic effect on the heart of catecholamines (which are released during physical and mental stress). This means that the usual increase in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac contractility and blood pressure, produced by the acute increase in catecholamines, is reduced by Metoprolol. Metoprolol interferes less with Insulin release and carbohydrate metabolism than do non-selective beta-blockers. Metoprolol interferes much less with the cardiovascular response to hypoglycaemia than do non-selective beta-blockers.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet-\rHypertension: Total daily dosage Metoprolol 100-400 mg to be given as a single or twice-daily dose. The starting dose is 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) per day. This may be increased by 100 mg per day at weekly intervals. lf full control is not achieved using a single daily dose, a b.i.d. regimen should be initiated. Combination therapy with a diuretic or other antihypertensive agents may also be considered.\rAngina: Usually Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) to 100 mg (two Metoprolol-50 tablets) twice or three times daily.\rCardiac arrhythmias: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) b.i.d or t.i.d should usually control the condition. It is necessary the dose can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. Following the treatment of an acute arrhythmia with Metoprolol injection, continuation therapy with Metoprolol tablets should be initiated 4-6 hours later. The initial oral dose should not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.\rHyperthyroidism: Metoprolol 50 mg (one Metoprolol-50 tablet) four times a day. The dose should be reduced as the euthyroid state is achieved.\rMyocardial infarction: Orally, therapy should commence 15 minutes after the last injection with 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Patients who fail to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be given half the suggested oral dose. Maintenance- The usual maintenance dose is 200 mg daily given in divided doses. Elderly\u2019 There are no special dosage requirements in otherwise healthy elderly patients. Significant hepatic dysfunction: A reduction in dosage may be necessary.\rExtended-release tablet-\rHypertension: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic.\rAngina Pectoris: The dosage of extended-release Metoprolol Succinate should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, in a single dose.\rHeart Failure: The recommended starting dose of sustained-release Metoprolol Succinate is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks.\rIV Injection-\rArrhythmias: By intravenous injection, up to 5 mg at a rate of 1-2 mg/minute, repeated after 5 minutes if necessary, total dose 10-15 mg.\rIn surgery: By slow intravenous injection 2-4 mg at induction or to control arrhythmias developing during anaesthesia; 2 mg doses may be repeated to a maximum of 10 mg.\rMyocardial Infarction: Early intervention within 12 hours of infarction, by intravenous injection 5 mg every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg, followed after 15 minutes by 50 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours; maintenance 200 mg daily in divided doses.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine\u2010depleting drugs (e.g. Reserpine, Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta\u2010blocking agents. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and propafenone are likely to increase Betaloc-XR concentration. These increases in plasma concentration would decrease the cardioselectivity of Betaloc-XR. Concomitant use of digitalis glycosides and beta\u2010blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia. Beta\u2010blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.\rContraindications\rAV block, Uncontrolled heart failure, severe bradycardia, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and severe peripheral arterial disease. Known hypersensitivity to Metoprolol or other B-blockers. Metoprolol is also contra-indicated when myocardial infarction is complicated by significant bradycardia, first-degree heart block, systolic hypotension (<100mmHg) and/or severe heart failure.\rSide Effects\rTiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, itching or rash, shortness of breath, slow heart rate, mental confusion, headache, somnolence, nightmares, insomnia, dyspnea, Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, flatulence, digestive tract disorders, heartburn, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, decreased libido, and tinnitus have also been reported, intensification of AV block.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in very small quantities. Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc-XR may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\rUse in Special Populations\rHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc-XR should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r Pediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc-XR have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r Geriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc-XR cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nln the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

Caution should be exercised when Metoprolol is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronchospastic Diseases: Because of its relative beta 1 \u2010selectivity, however, Betaloc-XR may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment.\r\n \nMajor Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta\u2010blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: Beta\u2010blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. Peripheral Vascular Disease: Beta\u2010blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nHepatic impaired patient: Betaloc-XR should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function.\r\n \nPediatric Use: No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of Betaloc-XR have not been established in patients <6 years of age.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse events between older and younger patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nPoisoning due to an overdose of metoprolol may lead to severe hypotension, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, impairment of consciousness, coma, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, hypoglycaemia and, occasionally, hyperkalaemia. The first manifestations usually appear 20 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Treatment: Treatment should include close monitoring of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal function, and blood glucose and electrolytes. Further absorption may be prevented by induction of vomiting, gastric lavage or administration of activated-charcoal if ingestion is recent. Cardiovascular complications should be treated symptomatically, which may require the use of sympathomimetic agents (e.g. noradrenaline, metaramionl), atropine or inotropic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine). Temporary pacing may be required for AV block. Glucagon can reverse the effects of excessive B-blockade, given in a dose of 1-10 mg intravenously. Intravenous B2-stimulants e.g. terbutaline may be required to relieve bronchospasm. Betaloc-XR cannot be effectively removed by haemodialysis.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.",

        "description": "Indications\rEssential hypertension: Amlocard is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Amlocard and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Amlocard and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Amlocard and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Amlocard did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Amlocard.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlocard may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlocard used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlocard is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlocard have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlocard should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen.

The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Telma Plus can be used alone or with other antihypertensive agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan: Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\r Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.\rDosage & Administration\rInitiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with-\rTelmisartan monotherapy 80 mg: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rHydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen: Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg once daily. Dose can be titrated up to 160 mg/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, if necessary.\rTelmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised before taking Telma Plus if you are taking aliskiren, digoxin, lithium, other medicines for high blood pressure, NSAIDs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, others), corticosteroids (such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, others), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockers (such as benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril) angiotensin II receptor blockers (such as losartan, olmesartan, valsartan). Telma Plus may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including parathyroid test, protein-bound iodide test), possibly causing false test results.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, Hydrochlorothiazide or any other component of this product. Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telma Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telma Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor. Be sure to drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration unless your doctor directs you otherwise.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric Use: In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision.\r Use in Patients with Renal Impairment: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (Cr.Cl. <30 ml/min) have not been established. In patients with severe renal impairment, Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Cr.Cl. 60 to 90 ml/min) or moderate (Cr.Cl. 30 to 60 ml/min) renal impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most likely manifestations of overdosage are hypertension, dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration etc. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis and the degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

Do not co-administer Aliskiren with this tablet in patients with Diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, tired feeling, flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling), back pain, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain. Other adverse events include allergy, fever, leg pain, chest pain, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth, elevations of liver enzymes or serum bilirubin, leg cramps, myalgia, dermatitis. Other adverse events that have been reported includes weakness, gastric irritation, photosensitivity, urticaria, muscle spasm, restlessness.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk, but telmisartan was shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor about your medical history, especially of kidney disease, liver disease, bile duct blockage, loss of too much body water and/or minerals (dehydration), untreated mineral imbalance (such as low or high potassium), gout, lupus. If you have diabetes, this medication may affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Telma Plus may affect your body potassium levels. Before using potassium supplements or salt substitutes that contain potassium, consult your doctor. Telma Plus may make you dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Report prolonged diarrhea or vomiting to your doctor.

        "description": "Indications\rProsan HZ is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\r\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\r\nHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\r\nImpaired renal function and\r\nSymptomatic hypotension\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r\n \nUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesan was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesan was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmesan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmesan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmesan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmesan has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmesan was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmesan and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmesan and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmesan, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmesan (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmesan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmesan.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Olmesan. The most likely effects of Olmesan overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmesan requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rOdrel Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOdrel Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Odrel Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Odrel Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture.

The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\r\nAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r\n \nAspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r\n \nHeparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r\n \nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r\n \nWarfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOdrel Plus is generally well tolerated.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nOdrel Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\r\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Odrel Plus.\r\nReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Odrel Plus or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAnti-platelet drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rLabeta Injection is indicated in Hypertension (including hypertension in pregnancy, hypertension after stroke, hypertension with angina, and hypertension following acute myocardial infarction); hypertensive crisis; Anaesthesia when a hypotensive technique is indicated.\rPharmacology\rLabetalol is an adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that has both selective alpha 1-adrenergic and nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking actions. Both the alpha and beta-blocking actions of Labetalol contribute to a decrease in blood pressure in hypertensive patients.\r Labetalol Hydrochloride is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The plasma half-life of Labetalol following oral administration is about 6 to 8 hours. Approximately 55% to 60% of a dose appears in the urine as conjugates or unchanged Labetalol within the first 24 hours of dosing. Doses of Labetalol Hydrochloride that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in mildly to severely hypertensive patients with normal renal function.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdult: The recommended initial dosage is 100 mg twice daily whether used alone or added to a diuretic regimen. The usual maintenance dosage of Labetalol Hydrochloride is between 200 and 400 mg twice daily.\rPatients with severe hypertension: May require from 1,200 to 2,400 mg per day, with or without thiazide diuretics. Titration increments should not exceed 200 mg twice daily.\rElderly Patients: The majority of elderly patients will require between 100 and 200 mg twice daily.\rInjection/Infusion:\rIntravenous Injection: If it is essential to reduce the blood pressure quickly a dose of 50 mg should be given by intravenous injection (over a period of at least one minute) and, if necessary, repeated at five minute intervals until a satisfactory response occurs. The total dose should not exceed 200 mg.\rIntravenous Infusion: For intravenous infusion the injcetion should be diluted with a suitable intravenous infusion fluid to a concentation of 1 mg/1 ml. Compatible fluids include solution of 5% Dextrose, 0.9% Sodium Chloride and mixture of Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rHypertension in pregnancy: Initially 20 mg/hour, then doubled every 30 minutes until a satisfactory response is obtained or a dosage of 160 mg/hour is reached.\rHypertension following acute myocardial infarction: Initially 15 mg/hour and gradually increased to a maximum of 120 mg/hour depending on the control of blood pressure.\rHypertension after stroke: 10-20 mg by intravenous injection over 1 to 2 minutes may repeat or doubled every 10 minutes. (max. dose 300 mg).\rHypertension due to other causes: Infuse at a rate of about 2 mg/min until a satisfactory response is obtained, then stop infusion. The effective dose is usually 50-200 mg but larger doses may be needed, especially in patients with phaeochromocytoma.\rHypotensive anaesthesia: The recommended starting dose of Labetalol Injection is 10-20 mg intravenously depending on the age and condition of the patient. Patients for whom halothane is contraindicated usually require a higher initial dose of 25-30 mg. If satisfactory hypotension is not achieved after 5 minutes, increments of 5-10 mg should be given until the desired level of blood pressure is attained.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rLabeta may enhance the hypotensive effects of halothane. Care should be taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with either Class I antiarrhythmic agents or calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. The hypotensive effect of Labeta may be reduced when used in combination with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (NSAIDs). Dosage adjustments may therefore be necessary. Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants may increase the incidence of tremor. Cimetidine may increase the bioavailability of Labeta and care is required in oral dosing of the latter.\rContraindications\rLabetalol is contraindicated for patients known to have hypersensitivity to the medicine. Labetalol is contraindicated in second or third degree heart block, infranodal A-V block, uncontrolled heart failure, sick-sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock and other conditions associated with severe and prolonged hypotension or severe bradycardia, and bronchial asthma or other obstructive lung disorders.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects reported are postural hypotension (avoid upright position during and for 3 hours after intravenous administration), tiredness, weakness, headache, rashes, scalp tingling, difficulty in micturition, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting; liver damage.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTeratogenic studies were performed with Labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was observed. Labetalol Hydrochloride given to pregnant women with hypertension did not appear to affect the usual course of labor and delivery. Small amounts of Labetalol (approximately 0.004% of the maternal dose) are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Labetalol tablets are administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThere have been rare reports of severe hepatocellular injury with Labeta therapy. The hepatic injury is usually reversible and has occurred after both short and long term treatment. If there is laboratory evidence of liver injury or the patient is jaundiced, Labeta therapy should be stopped and not re-started. Particular care should be taken when Labeta is to be used in patients with hepatic impairment. Labeta should be used with caution in patients with peripheral vascular disease as their symptoms may be exacerbated.\rOverdose Effects\rLabeta overdose causes excessive hypotension and sometimes, excessive bradycardia. If overdose with Labeta follows oral ingestion, gastric lavage or pharmacologically induced emesis (using syrup) may be useful for removal of the drug shortly after ingestion. The following additional measures should be employed if necessary: Excessive bradycardia-administer atropine; Cardiac failure-administer digitalis glycoside and diuretic; Hypotension-administer vasopressors (norepinephrine); Bronchospasm-administer epinephrine.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place protected from light.

        "description": "Indications\rBetapro is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rBetapro is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective \u00df1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betapro fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Betapro fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Betapro in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betapro fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Betapro fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect.

It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amdocal may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amdocal used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amdocal is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amdocal have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amdocal should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily. If necessary, the dosage may be increased to 5/25 mg two tablets daily or as advised by the physicians.

        "description": "Indications\rTemcard is indicated in-\r Hypertension: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.\rCardiovascular prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\rAtherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) or\rType 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\rTelpro - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-ll receptor antagonist. Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r Hepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\rCo-administration with aliskiren with Temcard: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Temcard tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r For patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Temcard tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\r\nCo-administration with aliskiren with Temcard: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Temcard tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r\n \nFor patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Temcard tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

This is a metered dose spray containing Nitrocard. Nitrocard delivers Nitrocard (400 mcg per spray, 200 metered sprays) in the form of spray droplets under the tongue.\rPharmacology\rThe principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a vasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and veins with more prominent effects on the latter. Dilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load).\rDosage\rAt the onset of an attack, 1 or 2 metered sprays should be administered under the tongue. No more than 3 metered sprays are recommended within a 15 minute period. If the chest pain persists, prompt medical attention is recommended.

Nitrocard should be used with caution in patients with severely impaired renal or hepatic function, hypothyroidism, malnutrition or hypothermia.\rUse in Special Populations\rSafety and effectiveness of Nitrocard in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rNitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse, heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions and possibly death due to circulatory collapse.\r Methemoglobinemia: Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin.\r Treatment of Overdosage: Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required.

        "description": "Indications\rEssential hypertension: Amlopin is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amlopin is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amlopin is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Amlopin and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Amlopin and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Amlopin and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Amlopin did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Amlopin.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlopin may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlopin used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlopin is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlopin have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlopin should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rAcemox is indicated in open angle glaucoma, secondary glaucoma and as an adjuvant in the treatment of edema and epilepsy.\rPharmacology\rAcetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons.

This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon-di-oxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In the eye, this inhibitory action of Acetazolamide decreases the secretion of aqueous humor and results in a drop in intraocular pressure, a reaction considered desirable in case of glaucoma. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system appears to retard abnormal paroxysmal and excessive discharge from central nervous system neurons. So, Acetazolamide is also used as an adjuvant in the treatment of epilepsy.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults : Initially 250 mg (1 tablet) 4 times daily. Dose should be adjusted later with individual need.\r\n \nChildren : \u00bd to 2 tablets in divided doses.\r\n \nIn intraocular pressure: 1 tablet 6 hourly.

        "description": "Indications\rTenoren is indicated-\rIn the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\rFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\rIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\rPharmacology\rThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block \u03b21 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on \u03b22-receptors. It is classified as a \u03b21 selective (cardioselective) \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available \u03b2- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r Angina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r Acute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Tenoren plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\rCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Tenoren.\rDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\rAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\rBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\rConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\rWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.\rBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rAtenolol is contraindicated in-\rSinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.\rThose patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug product\u2019s components.\rSide Effects\rIn a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Tenoren.\rHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\rAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\rCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\rGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\rMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\rOther: Erythematous rash\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Tenoren is administered. Initial and subsequent Tenoren dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Tenoren may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.\r Impaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.\r Geriatric Use:\rHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\rAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment: Tenoren is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, refecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renal impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes:\rCreatinine clearance 15-35 ml/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 50 mg daily\rCreatinine clearance <15 mL/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 25 mg daily\rSome renal impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of Tenoren: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage with Tenoren has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following Tenoren overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common efects associated with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in Tenoren overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Tenoren can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. Based on the severity of symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\r\nIndications\r\nTenoren is indicated-\r\nIn the management of hypertension.

Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage with Tenoren has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following Tenoren overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common efects associated with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in Tenoren overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Tenoren can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. Based on the severity of symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\rPack Image of Tenoren 25 mg Tablet\rPack Image: Tenoren 25 mg Tablet\nIndications\r\nTenoren is indicated-\r\nIn the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\r\nFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\r\nIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block \u03b21 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on \u03b22-receptors. It is classified as a \u03b21 selective (cardioselective) \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available \u03b2- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r\n \nAngina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r\n \nAcute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Tenoren plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\r\nCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Tenoren.\r\nDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\r\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\r\nBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\r\nConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\r\nWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.\r\nBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r\nContraindications\r\nAtenolol is contraindicated in-\r\nSinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.\r\nThose patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug product\u2019s components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Tenoren.\r\nHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\r\nAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\r\nCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\r\nGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\r\nMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\r\nOther: Erythematous rash\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nGeneral: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Tenoren is administered. Initial and subsequent Tenoren dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Tenoren may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.\r\n \nImpaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.\r\n \nGeriatric Use:\r\nHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\r\nAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment: Tenoren is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, refecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

        "description": "Indications\rTenoren Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\rPharmacology\rAtenolol and chlorthalidone have been used singly and concomitantly for the treatment of hypertension. Studies have shown that there is no interference with bioavailability when these agents are given together in the single combination tablet.

        "description": "Indications\rArbitel is indicated in-\r Hypertension: Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.\rCardiovascular prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with:\rAtherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease) or\rType 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage.\rPharmacology\rTelmisartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-ll receptor antagonist. Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r Hepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\rCo-administration with aliskiren with Arbitel: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Arbitel tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r For patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Arbitel tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium.

        "description": "Indications\rAbetis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rAbetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Abetis (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Abetis was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Abetis is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Abetis and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Abetis may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAbetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis.

If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protect from light and moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nOlmesartan Medoxomil & Hydrochlorothiazide combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHypertension: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily. Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks to two tablets 40/25 once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOlmesartan: No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesartan Medoxomil was co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. Olmesartan Medoxomil is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics:\r\nAlcohol, Barbiturates or Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r\nAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r\nOther antihypertensive drugs: Additive effect.\r\nCorticosteroids, ACTH.\r\nLithium.\r\nContraindications\r\nThe combination of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe common side-effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, hyperuricemia, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. Other adverse effects are chest pain, back pain, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhea.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafety and effectiveness in nursing mother & pregnancy have not been established. The drug should be discontinued during these conditions.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance like hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremic alkalosis.\r\nHyperuricemia may occur in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.\r\nImpaired renal function.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal Impairment Patients: The usual regimens of therapy with this may be followed provided the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. So, Abetis Plus is not recommended.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment Patients: No dosage adjustment is necessary with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: Clinical studies of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nOlmesartan: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia. Supportive treatment should be instituted.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration) resulting from excessive diuresis.

Spirocard is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spirocard causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium and magnesium is retained.\rPharmacology\rSpironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+ K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.\rDosage & Administration\rEdema in adults (congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome): An initial daily dosage of 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. Combined therapy with other diuretics is indicated when more rapid diuresis is desired.\r Primary hyperaldosteronism: After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism has been established, Spironolactone may be administered in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, Spironolactone may be employed for long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.\r Essential hypertension: For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended.\r Hypokalemia: Spironolactone in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic-induced hypokalemia.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rACE inhibitors: Concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors with potassium-sparing diuretics has been associated with severe hyperkalemia.\r Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia, may occur.\r Lithium: Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.\r Digoxin: Spirocard has been shown to increase the half-life of digoxin.\rContraindications\rSpironolactone is contraindicated in patients with acute renal insufficiency, significant impairment of renal function, anuria, hyperkalaemia or sensitivity to Spironolactone.\rSide Effects\rGynaecomastia may develop in association with the use of Spirocard.

        "description": "Indications\rNebicard is indicated in-\rHypertension\rTreatment of essential hypertension\rChronic heart failure (CHF)\rTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\rPharmacology\rNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNebicard should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Nebicard should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Nebicard may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Nebicard and clonidine, Nebicard should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Nebicard is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Nebicard should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Nebicard is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Nebicard should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Nebicard be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Nebicard should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Nebicard should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nebicard was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Nebicard is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Nebicard can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Nebicard should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Nebicard has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Nebicard should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Nebicard has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Nebicard is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nNebicard is indicated in-\r\nHypertension\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension\r\nChronic heart failure (CHF)\r\nTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\r\nPharmacology\r\nNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r\n \nMode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\r\ndecreased heart rate\r\ndecreased myocardia contractility\r\ndiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\r\nsuppression of renin activity and\r\nvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\r\nPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r\n \nAbsorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol.

        "description": "Pharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Bislol fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Bislol fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Bislol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Introduction\rRezor 40 is a medicine used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Lowering blood pressure helps to prevent future heart attack and stroke. This medicine is also effective in preserving kidney function in patients with diabetes. Rezor 40 can be prescribed either alone or in combination with other medicines. It may be taken with or without food during the day or at night. However, try to take it at the same time each day to get the maximum benefit. It is important to continue taking it regularly even if you feel well or if your blood pressure is controlled. Most people with high blood pressure do not feel ill, but if you stop taking this medicine, your condition could get worse. This is a widely used medicine and is considered safe for long-term use. Making some changes in your lifestyle will also help lower your blood pressure. These may include regular exercise, losing weight, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake, and reducing the amount of salt in your diet as advised by your doctor. This medicine is tolerated well by most patients and has few side effects. Dizziness, particularly after the first dose, is known to occur in some people. This may be associated with headache. Let your doctor know if these side effects bother you or do not go away. No weight gain has been seen with the regular use of this medicine. Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have any kidney or liver problems. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers should not take this medicine. Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure and potassium levels in your blood at regular intervals while you are taking this medicine.\rUses of Rezor 40\rHypertension (high blood pressure)\rHeart failure\rPrevention of heart attack and stroke\rSide effects of Rezor 40\rCommon\rCough\rDiarrhea\rDizziness\rFlu-like symptoms\rHeadache\rIndigestion\rNausea\rRunny nose\rSore throat\rStomach pain\rHow to use Rezor 40\rTake this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. Swallow it as a whole. Do not chew, crush or break it. Rezor 40 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time.\rHow Rezor 40 works\rRezor 40 is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It relaxes the blood vessel by blocking the action of a chemical that usually makes blood vessels tighter. This lowers the blood pressure, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly to different organs and the heart to pump more efficiently.\rWhat if you forget to take Rezor 40?\rIf you miss a dose of Rezor 40, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.\rQuick Tips\rTake it at the same time every day to help you remember to take it.\rIt can make you feel dizzy for the first few days. Rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down for a long time.\rYour doctor may get regular tests done to monitor the level of urea, creatinine, and potassium in your blood.\rAvoid taking anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen along with this medicine without consulting your doctor.\rIt may increase the level of potassium in the blood. Avoid taking potassium supplements and potassium-rich foods such as banana fruit juice, coconut water, and broccoli.\rDo not take Rezor 40 if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\rDo not stop taking it suddenly without talking to your doctor.\rBrief Description\rIndication\rHypertension, Diabetic nephropathy,\rAdult Dose\rOral Hypertension Adult: Initial: 10-20 mg once daily may then be increased up to max 40 mg once daily if needed. Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed. Hepatic impairment: Moderate: Initial: 10 mg once daily may increase up to max 20 mg once daily.\rChild Dose\rOral Hypertension Child: 6-16 yr <35 kg: 10 mg once daily; dosage range: 10-20 mg/day >35 kg: 20 mg once daily. Doses may be doubled once if necessary after 2 wk. dosage range: 20-40 mg/day\rRenal Dose\rRenal impairment: Mild to moderate (CrCl: 20-60 mL/min): Max: 20 mg once daily.\rContraindication\rPregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.\rMode of Action\rOlmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.\rPrecaution\rDrugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation. Lactation: No human data; use with caution\rSide Effect\r1-10% Dizziness,Headache,Fatigue,Diarrhea,Hyperglycemia,Hypertriglyceridemia,Back pain,Bronchitis,Inflicted injury,Flulike symptoms,Pharyngitis,Rhinitis,Sinusitis,Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) Frequency Not Defined (selected) Anaphylactic reaction,Angioedema,Facial edema,Rhabdomyolysis,Hyperkalemia,Tachycardia,Hypercholesterolemia,Gastroenteritis,Hyperlipidemia Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.\rPregnancy Category Note\rPregnancy category: 1st trimester, C; 2nd and 3rd trimesters, D\rInteraction\rIncreased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.\nIntroduction\r\nRezor 40 is a medicine used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.

Rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down for a long time.\r\nYour doctor may get regular tests done to monitor the level of urea, creatinine, and potassium in your blood.\r\nAvoid taking anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen along with this medicine without consulting your doctor.\r\nIt may increase the level of potassium in the blood. Avoid taking potassium supplements and potassium-rich foods such as banana fruit juice, coconut water, and broccoli.\r\nDo not take Rezor 40 if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\r\nDo not stop taking it suddenly without talking to your doctor.\r\nBrief Description\r\nIndication\r\nHypertension, Diabetic nephropathy,\r\nAdult Dose\r\nOral Hypertension Adult: Initial: 10-20 mg once daily may then be increased up to max 40 mg once daily if needed. Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed. Hepatic impairment: Moderate: Initial: 10 mg once daily may increase up to max 20 mg once daily.\r\nChild Dose\r\nOral Hypertension Child: 6-16 yr <35 kg: 10 mg once daily; dosage range: 10-20 mg/day >35 kg: 20 mg once daily. Doses may be doubled once if necessary after 2 wk. dosage range: 20-40 mg/day\r\nRenal Dose\r\nRenal impairment: Mild to moderate (CrCl: 20-60 mL/min): Max: 20 mg once daily.\r\nContraindication\r\nPregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.\r\nMode of Action\r\nOlmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.\r\nPrecaution\r\nDrugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation. Lactation: No human data; use with caution\r\nSide Effect\r\n1-10% Dizziness,Headache,Fatigue,Diarrhea,Hyperglycemia,Hypertriglyceridemia,Back pain,Bronchitis,Inflicted injury,Flulike symptoms,Pharyngitis,Rhinitis,Sinusitis,Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) Frequency Not Defined (selected) Anaphylactic reaction,Angioedema,Facial edema,Rhabdomyolysis,Hyperkalemia,Tachycardia,Hypercholesterolemia,Gastroenteritis,Hyperlipidemia Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.\r\nPregnancy Category Note\r\nPregnancy category: 1st trimester, C; 2nd and 3rd trimesters, D\r\nInteraction\r\nIncreased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure.

        "description": "Indications\rLosacor Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Introduction\rTems 40 is a medicine used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease. Lowering blood pressure helps to prevent future heart attack and stroke. This medicine is also effective in preserving kidney function in patients with diabetes. Tems 40 can be prescribed either alone or in combination with other medicines. It may be taken with or without food during the day or at night. However, try to take it at the same time each day to get the most benefit. It is important to continue taking it regularly even if you feel well or if your blood pressure is controlled. Most people with high blood pressure do not feel ill, but if you stop taking this medicine, your condition could get worse. This is a widely used medicine and is considered safe for long-term use. Making some changes in your lifestyle will also help lower your blood pressure. These may include regular exercise, losing weight, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol intake, and reducing the amount of salt in your diet as advised by your doctor. This medicine is tolerated well by most patients and has few side effects. Dizziness, particularly after the first dose, is known to occur in some people. This may be associated with headache. Let your doctor know if these side effects bother you or do not go away. No weight gain has been seen with the regular use of this medicine. Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have any kidney or liver problems. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers should also consult their doctor before taking it. Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure and potassium levels in your blood at regular intervals while you are taking this medicine.\rUses of Tems 40\rHypertension (high blood pressure)\rPrevention of heart attack and stroke\rHeart failure\rSide effects of Tems 40\rCommon\rBack pain\rDiarrhea\rNasal congestion (stuffy nose)\rSinus pain\rHow to use Tems 40\rTake this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor.

Tems 40 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time.\rHow Tems 40 works\rTems 40 is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It relaxes blood vessels by blocking the action of a chemical that usually makes blood vessels tighter. This lowers the blood pressure, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly to different organs and the heart to pump more efficiently.\rWhat if you forget to take Tems 40?\rIf you miss a dose of Tems 40, skip it and continue with your normal schedule.

The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the anti hypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartans is required, may switch to combination, a diuretic may be added. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients >75 years old or with hepatic impairment Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Cardiovascular risk reduction Adult:The recommended dose of telmisartan tablets is 80 mg once a day. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. When initiating telmisartan therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction, monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate, adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be necessary. Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with telmisartan is not recommended in patients ?75 years old or with hepatic impairment.\rChild Dose\r<18 years old: Safety and efficacy not established\rRenal Dose\rRenal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Titrate slowly in patients with severe renal impairment. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored.\rContraindication\rSevere hepatic impairment, biliary obstructive disorders. Pregnancy. Lactation.\rMode of Action\rTelmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\rPrecaution\rAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure, Hypotension, Monitor carefully in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, Avoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker.

Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients >75 years old or with hepatic impairment Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. Cardiovascular risk reduction Adult:The recommended dose of telmisartan tablets is 80 mg once a day. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. When initiating telmisartan therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction, monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate, adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be necessary. Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with telmisartan is not recommended in patients ?75 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\nChild Dose\r\n<18 years old: Safety and efficacy not established\r\nRenal Dose\r\nRenal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Titrate slowly in patients with severe renal impairment. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored.\r\nContraindication\r\nSevere hepatic impairment, biliary obstructive disorders. Pregnancy. Lactation.\r\nMode of Action\r\nTelmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\r\nPrecaution\r\nAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure, Hypotension, Monitor carefully in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, Avoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker. Hepatic insufficiency, biliary obstruction, renal impairment, renaly artery stenosis. Correct volume depletion before initiating treatment. Monitor serum potassium levels regularly, especially in elderly and renally-impaired patients.\r\nSide Effect\r\n1-10% Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (7%),Back pain (3%),Diarrhea (3%),Myalgia (3%),Sinusitis (3%),Chest pain (1%),Hypertension (1%),Headache (1%),Dizziness (1%),Pharyngitis (1%) <1% Abnormal ECG,Anemia,Angina,Angioedema,Bradycardia,Eczema,Epistaxis,Gout,Hypercholesterolemia,Hyperkalemia,Hypoglycemia,Otitis media Potentially Fatal: Rarely angioedema, rash, pruritus and urticaria.\r\nPregnancy Category Note\r\nPregnancy category: 1st trimester, C; 2nd and 3rd trimesters, D\r\nInteraction\r\nMay increase plasma levels of digoxin. May increase serum lithium levels and toxicity. May reduce plasma levels of warfarin. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ K-sparing diuretics, K supplements or K-containing salt substitutes.

        "description": "Indications\rRansys is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Ransys was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Ransys is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Ransys and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rRansys has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Ransys was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Ransys and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Ransys and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Ransys (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Ransys. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Ransys.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Ransys. The most likely effects of Ransys overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Ransys requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r In clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r The following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rPregnancy & lactation.\rBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\rSide Effects\rDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\rHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\rTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\rHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\rAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\rMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\rOverdose Effects\rTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r In clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r The following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rPregnancy & lactation.\rBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\rSide Effects\rDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\rHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\rTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\rHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\rAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\rMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\rOverdose Effects\rTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nAmiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nAdd-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r\n \nReplacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r\n \nTelmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r\n \nIn clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r\n \nThe following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nPregnancy & lactation.\r\nBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\r\nHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\r\nTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\r\nHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\r\nAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\r\nMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nAmiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia.

        "description": "Indications\rDezide is used to treat high blood pressure. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. This medication is a combination of two \"water pills\" (diuretics): triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. Dezide is used by people who have developed or are at risk for having low potassium levels on hydrochlorothiazide. It causes you to make more urine, which helps your body get rid of extra salt and water.\r This medication also reduces extra fluid in the body (edema) caused by conditions such as heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease. This can lessen symptoms such as shortness of breath or swelling in your ankles or feet.\rPharmacology\rTriamterene directly inhibits the exchange of Na for K and hydrogen in the distal renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of Na and Cl ions, and consequently of water, by reducing electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension: Initially, 1 tablet (Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and Triamterene 50 mg) daily after the morning meal, adjust thereafter according to response. Max: 4 tab daily.\r Oedema: Initially, 1 tablet (Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and Triamterene 50 mg) bid. Maintenance: 1 tab daily or 2 tab on alternate days.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of essential hypertension. Treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen.\rPharmacology\rIrbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by binding to AT1 receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: The usual recommended initial and maintenance dose is Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, with or without food. Irbesartan at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24 hour blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently controlled with Irbesartan 150 mg once daily, the dose of Irbesartan can be increased to Irbesartan 300 mg, or other anti-hypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Irbesartan. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at Irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to Irbesartan 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration of renal benefit of Irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where Irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure. \r Elderly: although consideration should be given to initiating therapy with Irbesartan 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly\r Paediatric: Irbesartan is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and other antihypertensive agents: prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Cavapro.\r Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassiumsparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended.\r Lithium: reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with Cavapro so far. Therefore, Cavapro is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid > 3 g/day and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Additional information on Cavapro interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r Lactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r Hyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r Primary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nTreatment of essential hypertension.

Cavapro is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when Cavapro was coadministered with warfarin, a drug metabolised by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of Cavapro have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of Cavapro.\r\nContraindications\r\nConcomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Pregnancy.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDiarrhoea, fatigue, dyspepsia or heartburn, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopaenia, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Irbesartan is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, substances that act directly on the renin-angiotensin-system can cause foetal or neonatal renal failure, foetal skull hypoplasia and even foetal death. As precautionary measure, irbesartan should preferably not be used during first trimester of pregnancy. A switch to a suitable alternative treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. If pregnancy is diagnosed, irbesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible, skull and renal function should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment was taken for a long period.\r\n \nLactation: Irbesartan is contraindicated during lactation. It is not known whether irbesartan is excreted in human milk. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Precautions: Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Irbesartan.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, depletion of intravascular volume, aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Renal impairment. Lactation.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nRenal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose of Cavapro 75 mg should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis. Intravascular volume depletion: volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Cavapro. \r\n \nHepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\r\n \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of Cavapro both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects.\r\n \nHyperkalaemia: as with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Cavapro, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.\r\n \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r\n \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to anti-hypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of Cavapro is not recommended.\r\n \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure. As with any anti-hypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nExperience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity. The most likely manifestations of overdosage are expected to be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Cavapro. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Cavapro is not removed by haemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rTherapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.\r Primary Hyperlipidemia: This tablet is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): This tablet is indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.\rPharmacology\rAtorvastatin: In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.\r Ezetimibe: Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production. Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dosage range is 10/10 mg to 80/20 mg daily. The recommended starting dose is 10/10 mg or 20/10 mg daily. This can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The recommended starting dose for patients who require a larger reduction in LDL-C (greater than 55%) is 40/10 mg daily. After initiation and/or upon titration of this medicine, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 or more weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\r Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is 40/10 mg or 80/10 mg daily. This should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.\r Patients with Hepatic Impairment: This is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels.\r Patients with Renal Impairment: A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for statin-associated myopathy. These patients need closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects. In patients with renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rThe risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole). The coadministration of Atova EZ with cyclosporine should be avoided. Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of Atova EZ with gemfibrozil should be avoided. The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Atova EZ is used in combination with niacin. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately. The increase in AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking Atova EZ. Caution should be exercised when prescribing Atova EZ with colchicine. If Atova EZ is added to warfarin, a coumarin anticoagulant, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be appropriately monitored.\rContraindications\rActive liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels. Hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects are rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, liver enzyme abnormalities, myalgia, abdominal pain, increased hepatic enzymes.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category X. This tablet is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy. Lipid-lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy, because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing Atova EZ with colchicine. Atova EZ therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.\r Liver Enzymes: It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with Atova EZ and repeated as clinically indicated. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Atova EZ, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart Atova EZ. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of Atova EZ.\r Endocrine Function: Caution should be exercised if Atova EZ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.\r Geriatric Use: In geriatric patients, no dosage adjustment is necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rNo specific treatment of overdosage can be recommended. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther lipid regulating drugs\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rBipinor is indicated in-\rHypertension\rTreatment of essential hypertension\rChronic heart failure (CHF)\rTreatment of stable mild and moderate chronic heart failure in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients.\rPharmacology\rNebivolol is a \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBipinor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Bipinor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Bipinor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Bipinor and clonidine, Bipinor should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Bipinor is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Bipinor should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Bipinor is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Bipinor should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Bipinor be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Bipinor should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Bipinor should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Bipinor was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Bipinor is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Bipinor can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Bipinor should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Bipinor has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Bipinor should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Bipinor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Bipinor is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r\n \nMetabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r\n \nDigoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r\n \nWarfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nBipinor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r\n \nBipinor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Bipinor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Bipinor and clonidine, Bipinor should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r\n \nCYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Bipinor is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\r\nContraindications\r\nNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Bipinor should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Bipinor is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Bipinor should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Bipinor be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r\n \nCardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Bipinor should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Bipinor should be considered.\r\n \nAngina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Bipinor was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r\n \nBronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r\n \nAnesthesia and Major Surgery: If Bipinor is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Bipinor can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r\n \nDiabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r\n \nThyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r\n \nPeripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r\n \nNon-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nImpaired Renal Function: Bipinor should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Bipinor has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r\n \nImpaired Hepatic Function: Bipinor should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Bipinor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Bipinor is contraindicated in this population. \r\n \nRisk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

The mechanism of its antihypertensive action is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, thus lowering total peripheral resistance. Lercanidipine is endowed with a prolonged antihypertensive activity because of its high membrane partition coefficient and is devoid of negative inotropic effects due to its high vascular selectivity.\rDosage & Administration\rUse in the elderly: The recommended dosage is 10 mg orally once a day at least 15 minutes before meals; the dose may be increased to 20 mg depending on the individual patient's response. It may take about 2 weeks before the maximal antihypertensive effect is apparent.\r Some individuals, not adequately controlled on a single antihypertensive agent, may benefit from the addition of Lercanidipine to therapy with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug (atenolol), a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) or an ACE inhibitor (ramiprii).\r Use in children: Since there is no clinical data in patients under the age of 18 years, use in children is not currently recommended.\r Use in renal or hepatic dysfunction: Special care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic dysfunction.

Caution should be exercised when Larcadip is co-prescribed with astemizole, amiodarone, quinidine, cimetidine, metoprolol and simvastatin.\rContraindications\rLercanidipine is contraindicated in patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, untreated congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina pectoris, within 1 month of a myocardial infarction and known hypersensitivity to any dihydropyridine. Lercanidipine should not be taken with grapefruit juice.\rSide Effects\rTreatment with Larcadip is generally well tolerated. The most common side effects are related to the vasodilatory properties of Larcadip such as flushing, peripheral edema, headache, dizziness and asthenia. Other side effects, which occurred in less than 1% of patients include fatigue; Gl disturbances such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and diarrhea, polyurea, rash, somnolence and myalgia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSince there is no clinical data with Lercanidipine in pregnancy, it should not be administered during pregnancy or to woman with child bearing potential unless effective contraception is used. Lercanidipine is highly lipophilic and distribution in milk may be expected. Therefore, it should not be administered to nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSpecial care should be exercised when Larcadip is used in patients with sick sinus syndrome, left ventricular dysfunction and ischaemic heart disease.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no data with Larcadip overdosage. As with other dihydropyridines, overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and reflex tachycardia.

        "description": "Indications\rEssential hypertension: Amlodipine is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r Interaction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Amlodipine and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Amlodipine and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Amlodipine and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Amlodipine did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Amlodipine.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlodipine may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlodipine used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlodipine is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlodipine have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlodipine should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r Interaction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r In clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r The following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil.

        "description": "Indications\rOstan Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.

In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans.

As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.\rDosage & Administration\rVerapamil Tablet:\rThe dose of Verapamil should be individualized by titration and the drug should be administered with food.\rFor essential hypertension the initial dose should be given 180 mg in the morning. If adequate response is not obtained with 180 mg of Verapamil then the dose may be titrated by following manner: 240 mg each morning. 180 mg each morning plus 180 mg each evening. 240 mg every 12 hourly.\rFor angina the usual dose is 80 mg to 120 mg three times a day.\rFor arrythmias in digitalized patients, Verapamil should be given 240 mg to 360 mg in divided doses, depending on the severity of the condition. Divided doses up to 180 mg/day may occasionally be needed.\rVerapamil Injection:\rAdults: 5 mg slowly intravenously, in tachycardias and hypertensive crises, if necessary repeat after 5 to 10 minutes. Drip infusion to maintain the therapeutic effect: 5-10 mg/hour in physiological saline, glucose, laevulose or similar solutions, on average up to a total dose of 100 mg/day. \r Children:\rNewborn: 0.75-1 mg (0.3-0.4 ml)\rInfants: 0.75-2 mg (0.3-0.8 ml)\rChildren age 1-5 years: 2-3 mg (0.8-1.2 ml)\rAge 6-14 years: 2.5-5 mg (1-2 ml)\rof Verapamil, given intravenously, depending on age and action. The injection should be made slowly under electrocardiographic control and only until onset of the effect. Intravenous infusion in hypertensive crises: initially 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/hour; if the effect proves to be insufficient, the dose is increased at 30-60 minute intervals until twice the dose or more is reached. Average total dose up to 1.5 mg/kg/day.\r Interaction\rMay increase plasma level with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ritonavir), cimetidine. May decrease plasma level with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin), phenobarbital, sulfinpyrazone. Increased risk of bleeding with aspirin. May increase bradycardic and hypotensive effect with telithromycin. Increased AV blocking effect with clonidine. May increase plasma level of cardiac glycosides (e.g. digoxin, digitoxin), \u03b2-blockers (e.g. propranolol, metoprolol), \u03b1-blockers (e.g. terazosin, prazosin), immunosuppressants (e.g. sirolimus, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus), lipid lowering agents (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin), colchicines, quinidine, carbamazepine, imipramine, glibenclamide, doxorubicin, midazolam, buspirone, almotriptan, theophylline. May potentiate hypotensive effect with diuretics, antihypertensives, vasodilators. May increase neurotoxic effect of lithium.\rContraindications\rSevere left ventricular dysfunction\rHypotension or cardiogenic shock\rSick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)\rSecond or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker)\rPatients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory by pass tract (eg. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome)\rPatients with known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochloride\rSide Effects\rVerapamil is generally well tolerated. The following reaction to orally administered Verapamil appeared clearly drug-related or occurred at rates greater than 1% in clinical trials with approximately 5000 patients.\rDigestive system: Constipation, nausea;\rCardiovascular system: Hypotension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, AV block;\rRespiratory system: Upper respiratory tract infections;\rNervous system: Dizziness, headache, fatigue;\rSkin: Rash, flashing;\rHepatic: Elevated liver enzyme.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, so this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and can be detected in umbilical vein blood during delivery. Verapamil is excreted in breast milk. So nursing should be discontinued while Verapamil is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken in 1st degree AV block, bradycardia <50 beats/minutes, hypotension <90 mm Hg systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation/flutter and simultaneous pre-excitation syndrome e.g. WPW syndrome, heart failure (previous compensation with cardiac glycosides/diuretics required). Verapamil may impair ability to drive or operate machinery, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and with concomitant consumption of alcohol. Verapamil markedly slows down the elimination of alcohol and prolongs the duration of the effects of alcohol.\rOverdose Effects\rTreatment of overdose should be supportive. Beta-adrenergic stimulation or parenteral administration of calcium solution may increase calcium ion flux across the slow channel and have been used in the treatment of overdose with Verapamil. Verapamil cannot be removed by hemodialysis.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis.

The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output.

The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nAmiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBislol Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bislol Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Bislol Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Bislol Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bislol Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Bislol Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r\n \nUse in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Bislol Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere are limited data on overdose with Bislol Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Alphapress is indicated in the treatment of all grades of essential (primary) hypertension and of all grades of secondary hypertension of variec etiology. It can be used as the initial and sole agent or it may be employed in a treatment program in combination with a diuretic and/or other antihypertensive drugs as needed for proper patient response. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are not impaired by long-term oral administration and thus Alphapress can be used with safety in hypertensive patients with impaired renal function.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress is indicated in the treatment of left ventricular failure. Alphapress may be added to the therapeutic regimen in those patients who have not shown a satisfactory response or who have become refractory to conventional therapy with diuretics, with or without cardiac glycosides.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: Alphapress indicated in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon and Raynaud's disease.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress is indicated as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of urinary obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also of value in patients awaiting prostatic surgery.\rPharmacology\rPrazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance through selective inhibition of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenoreceptors in vascular smooth muscle. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions; this effect is more pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure. Rebound elevation of blood pressure does not occur following abrupt cessation of Prazosin therapy.\r The therapeutic efficacy of Prazosin in patients with congestive heart failure is ascribed to a reduction in left ventricular filling pressure, reduction in cardiac impedance and an augmentation of cardiac output. The use of Prazosin in congestive heart failure does not provoke a reflex tachycardia and blood pressure reduction is minimal in normotensive patients. Prazosin reduce the severity of the signs, symptoms, frequency and duration of attacks, in patients with Raynaud's disease. In low dosage, antagonism of alpha-1-receptors on prostatic and urethral smooth muscle has been shown to improve the urinary pressure profile in men and to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical studies have shown that Prazosin therapy is not associated with adverse changes in the serum lipid profile.\rDosage & Administration\rPrazosin Tablet: There is evidence that toleration is best when therapy is initiated with a low starting dose. During the first week, the dosage of Prazosin should be adjusted according to the patient's individual toleration. Thereafter the daily dosage is to be adjusted on the basis of the patient's response. The response is usually seen within one to 14 days if it is to occur at any particular dose. When a response is seen, therapy should be continued at that dosage until the degree of response has reached optimum before the next dose increment is added.\rHypertension: For maximum benefit, small increases should be continued until the desired effect is achieved or a total daily dosage of 20 mg is reached. A diuretic or adrenergic beta-blocking agent may be added to enhance efficacy. The maintenance dosage of Prazosin may be given as a twice or three times daily regimen.\rPatients Receiving No Antihypertensive Therapy. It is recommended that therapy be initiated with 0.5 mg given in the evening at bedtime then 0.5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d for three to seven days. Unless poor toleration suggests the patient is unusually sensitive, this dosage should be increased to 1 mg given b.i.d. or t.i.d. for a further three to seven days. Thereafter, as determined by the patient's response to the blood pressure lowering effect, the dosage should be increased gradually to a total daily dosage of 20 mg given in divided doses.\rPatients Receiving Diuretic Therapy With inadequate Control of Blood Pressure. The diuretic should be reduced to a maintenance dosage level for the particular agent and Prazosin initiated with 0.5 mg h.s then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d or t.i.d. After the initial period of observation, the dosage of Prazosin should be gradually increased as determined by the patient's response.\rPatients Receiving Other Antihypertensives But With Inadequate Control. Because some additive effect is anticipated, the other agent dosage level (e.g. beta-adrenergic blocking agents, methyldopa. reserpine, lsnidine etc.) should be reduced and Prazosin initiated at 0.5 mg h.s. then proceeding to 0.5 mg b.i.d, or t.i.d. Subsequent dosage increase should be made depending upon the patient's response. There is evidence that adding Prazosin to beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium antagonists or ACE inhibitors may bring about a substantial reduction in blood pressure. Thus, to low initial dosage regimen is strong, recommended.\rPatients With Moderate to Severe Grades of Renal Impairment Evidence to date shows that Prazosin does not further compromise renal function when used in patients with renal impairment. Because some patients in this category have responded to small doses of Prazosin , it is recommended that therapy be initiated at 0.5 mg daily and that dosage increases be instituted cautiously.\rLeft Ventricular Failure: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg two, three or four times a day, Dosage should be titrated according to the patent's clinical response, based on careful monitoring of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, and when indicated, hemodynamic studies. Dosage titration steps may be performed as often as every two or three days in patients under close medical supervision. In severely ill, decompensated patients, rapid dosage titiration over one to two days may be indicated and is best done when hemodynamic- monitoring is available In dininai studies, the therapeutic dosages ranged from 4 mg to 20mg daily in divided doses. Adjustment of dosage may be required in the course of Prazosin therapy in some patients to maintain optimal clinical improvement.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5 mg b.i.d., t.i.d. or q.i.d. increasing to 4 mg in divided doses.\r Use Daily Maintenance Dosage: 4 mg once daily to 20 mg in divided doses.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon And Raynaud's Disease: The recommended starting dosage is 0.5 mg b.i.d. given for a period of three to seven days. Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.\r Suggested Starting Dosage: 0.5mg b.i.d.\r Usual Daily Maintenance Dosage: 1mg or 2 mg b.i.d Doses up to 2 mg t.i.d. may be required for some patients.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily given for a period of 3 to 7 days and should then be adjusted according to the patient's clinical responses. The usual maintenance dose is 2 mg twice daily. The safety and efficacy of a total daily dosage greater than 4 mg have not been established. Therefore, total daily dosages greater than 4mg should be used with caution.\r Prazosin XR Tablet: Prazosin XR Extended-Release Tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. Therapy for hypertension with Prazosin XR must be initiated at 2.5 mg once daily. The 5 mg dosage form of Prazosin XR is not for initial dosing. Dosage may be increased slowly, in general over a 7 to 14-day period, depending on the response to each dose level. Doses above 20 mg once daily have not been studied.\r Maintenance Dose: Dosage may be increased as clinically indicated to 20 mg given in once-daily doses.\r Hypertensive patients controlled on Prazosin Tablets alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications may be switched to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets at the equivalent or nearest higher total daily dose, e.g. Prazosin Tablets 4 mg daily equivalent to Prazosin XR Extended Release Tablets 5 mg once daily. Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the end of the dosing interval to assure adequate blood pressure control is maintained throughout the 24-hour period. Further titration may be necessary in some patients.\r The addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rAlphapress XR has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in clinical experience to date with the following:\rCardiac-glycosides-digitalis and digoxin;\rHypoglycemic agents-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide;\rtranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital;\rantiarrhythmic agents-procainamide, propranolol and quinidine; and\ranalgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents-propxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone type.\rContraindications\rPrazosin is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to quinazolines.\rSide Effects\rThe most common reactions associated with Alphapress therapy are dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations and nausea. In most instances, side effects have disappeared with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in the dosage of the drug. In addition, the following reactions have been associated with Alphapress therapy; vomiting diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort and/or pain, liver function abnormalities, pancreatitis, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, faintness, tachycardia, nervousness, vertigo, hallucinations, depression, paresthesia, rash, pruritus alopecia, lichen planus, urinary frequency, impotence, incontinence, priapism, blurred vision, reddened solera, epistaxis, tinnitus, dry mouth, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, fever, positive ANA liter, and arthralgia. Some of these reactions have occurred rarely, and in many instances, the exact causal relationships have not been established. Literature reports exist associating Alphapress, therapy with a worsening of pre-existing narcolepsy. A causal relationship is uncertain in these cases. The following have been observed in parents being managed for left ventricular failure with Alphapress when used in conjunction with cardiac glycosides and diuretics; drowsiness, dizziness, postural hypotension, blurred vision, edema, dry mouth, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, headache, and nasal congestion. In most instances, these occurrences have been mild to moderate in severity and have resolved with continued therapy or have been tolerated with no decrease in drug dosage. The most commonly although infrequently reported side effect in the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon/Disease was mild dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing; the safety of Prazosin use during. pregnancy has not yet been established. The use of prazosin and a beta-blocker for the control of sever hypertension of 44 pregnant women revealed no drug-related fetal adnormalities or adverse effects. Therapy with prazosin was continued for as long as 14 weeks. Prazosin has also been used alone or in combination with other hypotensive agents in severe hypertension or pregnancy. No fetal or neonatal abnormalities have been reported with the use of Prazosin. There are no adequate and well controlled studies that establish the safety of Prazosin in pregnant women. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only if in the opinion of the physician the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Prazosin has been shown to be excreted in small amounts in human milk. Caution shold be exercised when Prazosin is adminsitered to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: A very small percentage of patients have responded in an abrupt and exaggerated manner to the initial dose of Alphapress. Postural hypotension evidenced by dizziness and weakness, or rarely loss of consciousness, has been reported, particularly with the commencement of therapy, but this effect is readily avoided by initiating treatment with a low dose of Alphapress XR and with small increases in dosage during the first one to two weeks of therapy. The effect when observed is not related to the severity of hypertension is self-limiting and in most patients does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration steps. When instituting therapy with any effective antihypertensive agent, the patient should be advised how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of Alphapress therapy.\r Left Ventricular Failure: When prazosin is initially administered to patients with left ventricular failure who have undergone vigorous diuretic or other vasodilator treatment, particularly in higher than the recommended starting dose, the resultant decrease in left ventricular filling pressure may be associated with a significant fall in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. In such patients, observance of the recommended starting dose of prazosin followed by gradual titration is particularly important. (See dosage and administration). In occasional patients with left ventricular failure, the clinical efficacy of Alphapress has been reported to diminish after several months of treatment. In these patients, there is usually evidence of weight gain or peripheral edema indicating fluid retention. Since spontaneous deterioration may occur in such severely ill patients a causal relationship to prazosin therapy has not been established. Thus, as with all patients with left ventricular failure, careful adjustment of diuretic dosage according to the patient's clinical condition is required to prevent excessive fluid retention and consequent relief of symptoms. In those patients without evidence of fluid retention, when clinical improvement has diminished; an increase in the dosage, of Alphapress will usually restore clinical efficacy.\r Raynaud's Phenomenon and Raynaud's Disease: Because Alphapress decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and titration of Alphapress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medication that are known the lower blood pressure.\r Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Alphapress decreases peripheral vasular resistance and since many patients with this disorder are elderly, careful monitoring of blood pressure during initial administration and during adjustment of the dose of Alphapress is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Alphapress is not recommended for the treatment of children under the age of 12 years since safe conditions for its use have not been established.\r Left Ventricular Failure: Alphapress is not recommended in the treatment of left ventricular failure due to mechanical obstrcution such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, pulmonary embolism and restrictive pericardial disease. Adequate data are not yet available to establish efficacy in patients with left ventricular failure due to a recent myocardial infarction.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental ingestion of at least 50 mg of Alphapress in a two-year child resulted in profound drowsiness and depressed reflexes, No decrease in blood pressure was noted. Recovery was uneventful. Should overdosage lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\rTherapeutic Class\rAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C.

If this measure is inadequate, shock should first be treated with volume expanders. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used. Renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Laboratory data indicate Alphapress is not dialyzable because it is protein bound.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAlpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep away from light and moisture, store below 30\u00b0C.

Abecab drug is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Ostan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r Renal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Ostan is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\rPharmacology\rLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Ostan. Concomitant use of Ostan and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Ostan are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Ostan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Ostan is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Ostan is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Ostan should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Ostan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r\n \nRenal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Ostan is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\r\nPharmacology\r\nLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r\n \nPatients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r\n \nPatients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Ostan. Concomitant use of Ostan and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\r\nContraindications\r\nLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe side effects with the use of Ostan are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse of Ostan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Ostan is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r\n \nUse in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Ostan is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.

        "description": "Indications\rDisys Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of anangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled with Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, should switch to Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination once daily. Highest allowed dose of Valsartan should not be greater than 320 mg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. \r For Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\r Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rValsartan:\rDiuretics: Patient on diuretics may occasionally experience excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Valsartan. No drug interaction of clinical significance has been identified with thiazide diuretics. \rAgents increasing Serum Potassium: Since Valsartan decreases the production of aldosterone, potassium supplements or salt containing potassium substitutes may lead to hyperkalemia. \rLithium Salts: As with other drugs which eliminate sodium, lithium clearance may be reduced. Therefore, serum lithium levels should be monitored carefully if lithium salts are to be administered.\rOther drugs showing interaction are Warfarin, Digoxin.\rHydrochlorothiazide:\rWhen administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate antihypertensive effect or orthostatic hypotension may occur.\rAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\rOther antihypertensive drugs give additive effect.\rCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.\rContraindications\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r Nursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Valsartan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder. \r Impaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment because thiazides may precipitate azotemia. \r Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with Disys Plus may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in patients with Hepatic Impairment: Care should be taken in patient with hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rValsartan: Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. \r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration) resulting from excessive diuresis. if digitalis has also been administered with it, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore between 15-30\u00b0 C.\nIndications\r\nDisys Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\r\nPharmacology\r\nValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

Highest allowed dose of Valsartan should not be greater than 320 mg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. \r\n \nFor Elderly: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\r\n \nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nValsartan:\r\nDiuretics: Patient on diuretics may occasionally experience excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiation of therapy with Valsartan. No drug interaction of clinical significance has been identified with thiazide diuretics. \r\nAgents increasing Serum Potassium: Since Valsartan decreases the production of aldosterone, potassium supplements or salt containing potassium substitutes may lead to hyperkalemia. \r\nLithium Salts: As with other drugs which eliminate sodium, lithium clearance may be reduced. Therefore, serum lithium levels should be monitored carefully if lithium salts are to be administered.\r\nOther drugs showing interaction are Warfarin, Digoxin.\r\nHydrochlorothiazide:\r\nWhen administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate antihypertensive effect or orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r\nAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r\nOther antihypertensive drugs give additive effect.\r\nCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.\r\nContraindications\r\nThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe combination of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Valsartan is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder. \r\n \nImpaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment because thiazides may precipitate azotemia. \r\n \nHeart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with Disys Plus may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r\n \nUse in patients with Hepatic Impairment: Care should be taken in patient with hepatic impairment.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nValsartan: Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. \r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration) resulting from excessive diuresis. if digitalis has also been administered with it, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore between 15-30\u00b0 C.",

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBetabis Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Betabis Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Betabis Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Betabis Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Betabis Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Betabis Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rAtenolol is indicated-\rIn the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\rFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\rIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\rPharmacology\rThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block \u03b21 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on \u03b22-receptors. It is classified as a \u03b21 selective (cardioselective) \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available \u03b2- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r Angina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r Acute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r Interaction\rCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\rCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Atenolol.\rDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\rAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\rBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\rConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\rWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.\rBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rAtenolol is contraindicated in-\rSinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.\rThose patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug product\u2019s components.\rSide Effects\rIn a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Atenolol.\rHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\rAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\rCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\rGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\rMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\rOther: Erythematous rash\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent Atenolol dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.\r Impaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.\r Geriatric Use:\rHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\rAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment: Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, refecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renal impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes:\rCreatinine clearance 15-35 ml/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 50 mg daily\rCreatinine clearance <15 mL/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 25 mg daily\rSome renal impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of Atenolol: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage with Atenolol has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following Atenolol overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common efects associated with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in Atenolol overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Atenolol can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. Based on the severity of symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\nIndications\r\nAtenolol is indicated-\r\nIn the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\r\nFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\r\nIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block \u03b21 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on \u03b22-receptors. It is classified as a \u03b21 selective (cardioselective) \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available \u03b2- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r\n \nAngina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r\n \nAcute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r\n \nInteraction\r\nCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\r\nCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Atenolol.\r\nDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.

        "description": "Indications\rAmlodipine and Valsartan combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of Angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of Angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for Angiotensin II synthesis. Amlodipine and Valsartan have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both Amlodipine and Valsartan lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but calcium influx blockade and reduction of Angiotensin II vasoconstriction are complementary mechanisms.\rDosage & Administration\rTreatment of hypertension: Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 2.5 mg - 10 mg while Valsartan is effective in doses of 80 mg-320 mg. In clinical trials with Amlodipine and Valsartan, using amlodipine doses of 5 mg-10 mg and Valsartan doses of 160 mg-320 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. This combination may be administered with or without food. This combination may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Amlodipine alone or with Valsartan alone may be switched to this combination therapy.\r Elderly patients: Because of decreased clearance of Amlodipine, therapy should usually be initiated at 2.5 mg.\r Renal Impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmesartan Medoxomil & Hydrochlorothiazide combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin-II formed from angiotensin-I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In-vitro-binding studies indicate that Olmesartan is a reversible & competitive inhibitor of AT 1 receptor. Olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase-I, the enzyme that converts angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrades bradykinin).\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases Aldosterone secretion & urinary Potassium loss and decreases serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin-II. So, co-administration of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The usual starting dose is 20/12.5 mg one tablet once daily. Dosing should be individualized. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks to two tablets 40/25 once daily.\r Interaction\rOlmesartan: No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmesartan Medoxomil was co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. Olmesartan Medoxomil is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics:\rAlcohol, Barbiturates or Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\rAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\rOther antihypertensive drugs: Additive effect.\rCorticosteroids, ACTH.\rLithium.\rContraindications\rThe combination of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rThe common side-effects are nausea, headache, dizziness, hyperuricemia, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. Other adverse effects are chest pain, back pain, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafety and effectiveness in nursing mother & pregnancy have not been established. The drug should be discontinued during these conditions.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals to detect possible electrolyte imbalance like hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremic alkalosis.\rHyperuricemia may occur in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.\rImpaired renal function.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal Impairment Patients: The usual regimens of therapy with this may be followed provided the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. So, this preparation is not recommended.\r Hepatic Impairment Patients: No dosage adjustment is necessary with hepatic impairment.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: Clinical studies of Olmesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide combination did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious.\rOverdose Effects\rOlmesartan: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia. Supportive treatment should be instituted.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration) resulting from excessive diuresis.

        "description": "Indications\rTelmivas AM is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rPharmacology\rThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Amiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Add-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r Replacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r In clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r The following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rPregnancy & lactation.\rBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\rSide Effects\rDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\rHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\rTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\rHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\rAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\rMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r Hepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\rOverdose Effects\rTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r Amiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output.

Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nTelmivas AM is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents. It may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis is a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan and Amiodipine. Telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), is specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Therefore, Telmisartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nAmiodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ion into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amiodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nInitial Therapy: Patient may be initiated on this tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is 40/5 mg once daily. Patients requiring larger blood pressure reductions may be started with 80/5 mg once daily. Initial therapy with this is not recommended in patients 575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r\n \nAdd-on Therapy: Patients not adequately controlled with amiodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amiodipine who experience adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to this 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amiodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.\r\n \nReplacement Therapy: Patients receiving amiodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive this tablets containing the same component doses once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of this tablet is 80/10 mg once daily.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amiodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19.\r\n \nTelmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\r\n \nIn clinical trials, amiodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\r\n \nThe following have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of amiodipine: cimetidine, grapefruit juice, sildenafil. Amiodipine has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the following: atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin.\r\nContraindications\r\nKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\r\nPregnancy & lactation.\r\nBiliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, left ventricle outflow tract obstruction.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDizziness, peripheral edema, migraine, headache, paraesthesia, vertigo, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, myalgia, spasm, erectile dysfunction,chest pain, fatigue, edema etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). It is not known whether telmisartan and amiodipine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure\r\nHypotension: Correct any volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy. Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension\r\nTitrate slowly in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment\r\nHeart failure: Monitor for worsening\r\nAvoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker\r\nMyocardial infarction: Uncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or increased angina.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amiodipine combination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nTelmisartan: Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of over dosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nAmiodipine: Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly reflex tachycardia. If massive overdose occur, active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent bipod pressure measurements are essential. If hypotension occur, cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output. Amiodipine is not removed by hemodialysis.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Protect from light and high humidity.

Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rVasocor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Vasocor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Vasocor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Vasocor and clonidine, Vasocor should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Vasocor is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Vasocor should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Vasocor is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Vasocor should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Vasocor be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Vasocor should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Vasocor should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Vasocor was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Vasocor is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Vasocor can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Vasocor should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Vasocor has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Vasocor should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Vasocor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Vasocor is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Nebivolol inhibits both \u03b21 and \u03b21 adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic and membrane stabilizing activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. At clinically relevant doses, Nebivolol does not demonstrate \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockade activity. Various metabolites, including glucuronides, contribute to beta-blocking activity.\r Mode of Action of Nebivolol involved include:\rdecreased heart rate\rdecreased myocardia contractility\rdiminution of tonic sympathetic outflow to the periphery from cerebral vasomotor centers\rsuppression of renin activity and\rvasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance\rPharmacokinetics: Nebivolol is metabolized by a number of routes, including glucuronidation and hydroxylation by CYP2D6. The active isomer (d-nebivolol) has an effective half-life of about 12 hours in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (most people), and 19 hours in poor metabolizers and exposure to d-nebivolol is substantially increased in poor metabolizers. This has less importance than usual, however, because the metabolites, including the hydroxyl metabolite and glucuronides (the predominant circulating metabolites), contribute to b blocking activity.\r Absorption and Distribution: Absorption of Nebivolol is similar to an oral solution. Mean peak plasma nebivolol concentrations occur approximately 1.5 to 4 hours post-dosing in EMs and PMs. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol. Nebivolol may be administered without regard to meals. The in vitro human plasma protein binding of nebivolol is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin, and is independent of nebivolol concentrations.\r Metabolism and Excretion: Nebivolol is predominantly metabolized via direct glucuronidation of parent and to a lesser extent via N-dealkylation and oxidation via cytochrome P450 2D6. After a single oral administration of 14C-nebivolol, 38% of the dose was recovered in urine and 44% in feces for EMs and 67% in urine and 13% in feces for PMs.\r Digoxin: Concomitant administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily) and digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) for 10 days in 14 healthy adult individuals resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or nebivolol.\r Warfarin: Administration of Nebivolol (10 mg once daily for 10 days) led to no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of nebivolol or R- or S-warfarin following a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. Similarly, nebivolol has no significant effects on the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as assessed by Prothrombin time and INR profiles from 0 to 144 hours after a single 10 mg warfarin dose in 12 healthy adult volunteers. The starting dose should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No formal studies have been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment and nebivolol should be contraindicated for these patients.\rDosage & Administration\rThe dose of Nebivolol should be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rVasocor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and \u03b2-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\r Vasocor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blockers. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added \u03b2-blocking action of Vasocor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients who are receiving Vasocor and clonidine, Vasocor should be discontinued for several days before the gradual tapering of clonidine.\r CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Use caution when Vasocor is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors (quinidine, propafenone, fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.)\rContraindications\rNebivolol is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >B), and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rHeadache, nausea and bradycardia.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAbrupt Cessation of Therapy: Patients with coronary artery disease treated with Vasocor should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with \u03b2-blockers. Myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. Even patients without overt coronary artery disease should be cautioned against interruption or abrupt discontinuation of therapy. As with other \u03b2-blockers, when discontinuation of Vasocor is planned, patients should be carefully observed and advised to minimize physical activity. Vasocor should be tapered over 1 to 2 weeks when possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that Vasocor be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily.\r Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and (\u03b2-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In patients who have compensated congestive heart failure, Vasocor should be administered cautiously. If heart failure worsens, discontinuation of Vasocor should be considered.\r Angina and Acute Myocardial Infarction: Vasocor was not studied in patients with angina pectoris or who had a recent Ml.\r Bronchospastic Diseases: In general, patients with bronchospastic diseases should not receive (3-blockers.\r Anesthesia and Major Surgery: If Vasocor is to be continued perioperatively, patients should be closely monitored when anesthetic agents which depress myocardial function, such as ether, cyclopropane, and trichloroethylene, are used. If \u03b2-blocking therapy is withdrawn prior to major surgery, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. The \u03b2-blocking effects of Vasocor can be reversed by \u03b2-agonists, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Additionally, difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has been reported with (\u03b2-blockers).\r Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: \u03b2-blockers may mask some of the manifestations of hypoglycemia, particularly tachycardia. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers may potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia and delay recovery of serum glucose levels. It is not known whether nebivolol has these effects. Patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia, or diabetic patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, should be advised about these possibilities and nebivolol should be used with caution.\r Thyrotoxicosis: \u03b2-blockers may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of \u03b2-blockers may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate a thyroid storm.\r Peripheral Vascular Disease: \u03b2-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in these patients.\r Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be used in patients treated concomitantly with these agents and ECG and blood pressure should be monitored.\rUse in Special Populations\rImpaired Renal Function: Vasocor should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment because of decreased renal clearance. Vasocor has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis.\r Impaired Hepatic Function: Vasocor should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of decreased metabolism. Since Vasocor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, Vasocor is contraindicated in this population. \r Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions: While taking \u03b2-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenges either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Cilnidipine binds to the dihydropy-ridine binding sites of the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel and inhibits Ca2+ influx across the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells via this channel, consequently vascular smooth muscle is relaxed, causing vasodilation. Cilnidipine inhibits Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channels in the sympathetic nerve cell membrane. The inhibition of Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channel was observed over a similar range of drug concentrations to those inhibiting L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channels. Consequently, release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals would be inhibited. Cilnidipine is considered to suppress the reflex increase in heart rate after blood pressure reduction.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 5-10 mg once daily after breakfast.

Cilnidipine binds to the dihydropy-ridine binding sites of the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel and inhibits Ca2+ influx across the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells via this channel, consequently vascular smooth muscle is relaxed, causing vasodilation. Cilnidipine inhibits Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channels in the sympathetic nerve cell membrane. The inhibition of Ca2+ influx via N-type voltage dependent calcium channel was observed over a similar range of drug concentrations to those inhibiting L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channels. Consequently, release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals would be inhibited. Cilnidipine is considered to suppress the reflex increase in heart rate after blood pressure reduction.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: 5-10 mg once daily after breakfast.

        "description": "Indications\rLosatan HZ tablet is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C.

It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losatan. Concomitant use of Losatan and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Losatan are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Losatan during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losatan is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losatan is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.

Angiotensin-ll is formed from angiotensin-l in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin-ll is the principal agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-ll by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-ll to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin-ll synthesis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (>3,000 fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Because Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-ll), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Telmisartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Telmisartan tablets is 40 mg once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg Telmisartan is required, may switch to the combination. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Telmisartan tablets may be administered with or without food. Initial therapy with Telmisartan is not recommended in patients \u226575 years old or with hepatic impairment.\r Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Telmisartan in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients.\r Hepatic impairment: Monitor carefully and up titrate slowly in patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNSAIDS: Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect.\rCo-administration with aliskiren with Telmivas: in patients with diabetes should be avoided.\rContraindications\rKnown hypersensitivity to this product or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rIn hypertensive patients: The most common side effects of Telmivas tablets include sinus pain and congestion (sinusitis), back pain, diarrhea etc.\r For patients of cardiovascular risk reduction: The most common side effects of Telmivas tablets in CV risk reduction include intermittent claudication and skin ulcer.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimester).

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily. If necessary, the dosage may be increased to 5/25 mg two tablets daily or as advised by the physicians.

Additive negative inotropic effects on the heart may be produced.\r Ampicillin: at doses of 1 gm and above may reduce Atenolol levels.\r Oral antidiabetics and insulin: Beta-blockers may decrease tissue sensitivity to insulin and inhibit insulin secretion e.g. in response to oral antidiabetics. Atenolol has less potential for these actions.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to either component, sinus bradycardia, second and higher degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, congestive heart failure, poor left ventricular function.\rSide Effects\rThe combination of Amlodipine and Atenolol is well tolerated. Overall side-effects include\rfatigue, headache, edema, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety and depression.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe combination should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential fetal risk. The combination should not be used by nursing mothers. If its use is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be stopped.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronchospasm: The combination should be used with caution in patients with airway obstruction.\r Renal impairment: The combination can be used in patients with renal impairment. However, caution may be necessary if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min because of possible reduction in the excretion of unchanged Atenolol.\r Hepatic impairment: Caution may be necessary in the use of the combination in patients with severe liver damage because of prolongation of the elimination half-life of Amlodipine.\r Drug withdrawal: Since coronary heart disease may exist without being recognized, patients should be warned against stopping the drug suddenly.

Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Amlovas and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Amlovas and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Amlovas and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Amlovas did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Amlovas.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlovas may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlovas used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlovas is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlovas have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlovas should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

The Furosemide component inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter in the ascending Loop of Henle and blocks the reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride ions; thereby increasing the quantity of sodium and the volume of water excreted in the urine. This characteristically induces potassium loss. The spironolactone component inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at the distal tubule by antagonising the action of aldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly favoured and the excess loss of potassium, induced by the Furosemide, is reduced\rDosage & Administration\rFurosemide 20 and spironolactone 50 mg: 1 to 4 tablets daily (20 to 80 mg of Furosemide and 50 to 200 mg of spironolactone) according to the patient\u2019s response.\r Furosemide 40 and spironolactone 50 mg: For previously stabilized patients requiring a higher dosage of spironolactone and Furosemide, This tablet can be used at a dose of one to two tablets daily (Furosemide 40 to 80 mg and spironolactone 50 to 100 mg).\r Use in children: Spironolactone and Furosemide is not suitable for use in children.

Spironolactone increases the levels of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin in the blood and this may result in digitalis toxicity. Corticosteroids may cause hypokalemia if they are used with Spironolactone. The blood pressure lowering and diuretic effects of Furosemide may be reduced or abolished when used together with indomethacin and possibly other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furosemide may increase the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Simultaneous administration of sucralfate and Furosemide may reduce the natriuretic and anti-hypertensive effect of Furosemide.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with anuria, acute renal insufficiency, rapidly deteriorating or severe impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min), hyperkalaemia, Addison's disease and in patients who are hypersensitive to Spironolactone, Furosemide or sulphonamides.\rSide Effects\rSpironolactone may give rise to headache and drowsiness and gastrointestinal distress, including cramp and diarrhoea. Ataxia, mental confusion, and skin rashes have been reported as side effect. Gynaecomastia is not uncommon and in rare cases breast enlargement may persist. Other endocrine disorders including hirsutism, deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities and impotence. Transient increase in blood-urea-nitrogen concentrations may occur and mild acidosis has been reported. Spironolactone may cause hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Excessive diuresis may result in dehydration and reduction in blood volume with circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism particularly in elderly patients. Serious depletion of potassium and magnesium may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Spironolactone and its metabolites may cross the placental barrier. The use of spironolactone in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and fetus. Animal teratology studies indicate that Furosemide may cause fetal abnormalities. Therefore, Furosemide should only be used in women in child bearing age when appropriate contraceptive measures are taken or if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.\r Lactation: Metabolites of Spironolactone have been detected in breast milk. If use of Spironolactone is considered essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted. Furosemide is excreted in breast milk and breast-feeding should be discontinued if treatment is essential.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients liable to electrolyte deficiency.

Spirocard is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spirocard causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium and magnesium is retained.\rPharmacology\rSpironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+ K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.\rDosage & Administration\rEdema in adults (congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome): An initial daily dosage of 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. Combined therapy with other diuretics is indicated when more rapid diuresis is desired.\r Primary hyperaldosteronism: After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism has been established, Spironolactone may be administered in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, Spironolactone may be employed for long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.\r Essential hypertension: For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended.\r Hypokalemia: Spironolactone in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic-induced hypokalemia.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rACE inhibitors: Concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors with potassium-sparing diuretics has been associated with severe hyperkalemia.\r Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia, may occur.\r Lithium: Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.\r Digoxin: Spirocard has been shown to increase the half-life of digoxin.\rContraindications\rSpironolactone is contraindicated in patients with acute renal insufficiency, significant impairment of renal function, anuria, hyperkalaemia or sensitivity to Spironolactone.\rSide Effects\rGynaecomastia may develop in association with the use of Spirocard.

Spirocard is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spirocard causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium and magnesium is retained.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSpironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+ K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nEdema in adults (congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome): An initial daily dosage of 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. Combined therapy with other diuretics is indicated when more rapid diuresis is desired.\r\n \nPrimary hyperaldosteronism: After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism has been established, Spironolactone may be administered in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, Spironolactone may be employed for long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.\r\n \nEssential hypertension: For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended.\r\n \nHypokalemia: Spironolactone in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic-induced hypokalemia.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nACE inhibitors: Concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors with potassium-sparing diuretics has been associated with severe hyperkalemia.\r\n \nAlcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r\n \nCorticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia, may occur.\r\n \nLithium: Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.\r\n \nDigoxin: Spirocard has been shown to increase the half-life of digoxin.\r\nContraindications\r\nSpironolactone is contraindicated in patients with acute renal insufficiency, significant impairment of renal function, anuria, hyperkalaemia or sensitivity to Spironolactone.\r\nSide Effects\r\nGynaecomastia may develop in association with the use of Spirocard.

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmevas was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmevas is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmevas, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmevas and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmevas may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmevas has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmevas was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmevas and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmevas and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmevas and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmevas, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmevas (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmevas. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmevas.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmevas. The most likely effects of Olmevas overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmevas requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmevas was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmevas is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmevas, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmevas and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmevas may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmevas has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmevas was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmevas and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmevas and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmevas and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmevas, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmevas (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmevas. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmevas.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Olmevas. The most likely effects of Olmevas overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmevas requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet once daily in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with separately administered monocomponent products of the same doses as the recommended fixed-dose combination.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCombinations not recommended: Calcium antagonists of the verapamil and diltiazem type, centrally-acting antihypertensive drugs.\r Combinations to be used with caution: Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, simvastatin, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, parasympathomimetic drugs, topical beta-blockers (e.g. eye drops), insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs, anesthetic agents, digitalis glycosides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sympathomimetic agents, antihypertensive agents and other drugs with blood pressure lowering potential.\r Combinations to be considered: Mefloquine, Rifampicin, Ergotamine derivatives, MAO inhibitors (except MAO-B inhibitor).\rContraindications\rAcute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation, obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis), cardiogenic shock, second or third degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, sinoatrial block, symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, severe bronchial asthma, severe forms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease or severe forms of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, untreated phaeochromocytoma metabolic acidosis, hypersensitivity to bisoprolol, amlodipine, dihydropyridine derivates or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Dizziness, headache, somnolence, palpitations, flushing, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain; edema (e.g. ankle edema), fatigue.\r Uncommon: Insomnia, mood changes (incl. anxiety), depression, sleep disorders, hypaesthesia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, tremor, visual disturbances (incl. diplopia), tinnitus, AV conduction disturbances, worsening of pre existing heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, dyspnea, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma or a history of obstructive airway disease, rhinitis, dyspepsia, dry mouth, alopecia, purpura, skin discoloration, pruritus, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle cramps, back pain, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakisuria, potency disorders, gynecomastia, asthenia, chest pain, pain, malaise, weight increase, weight decrease.\r Rare: Allergic reactions mainly affecting the skin, nightmares, hallucinations, confusion, decreased tear secretion, hearing disorders, allergic rhinitis, hepatitis, increased triglycerides, increased liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with heart failure should be treated with caution. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function cannot be excluded. Since the abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to a transitory worsening of the clinical condition, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, the treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Caution is advised in patients with impaired hepatic function. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with obstructive airways diseases unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Due to the bisoprolol component treatment must be used with caution in: bronchospasm (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease; concomitant bronchodilating therapy may be recommended); diabetes mellitus showing large fluctuations in blood glucose values, symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked; strict fasting; ongoing desensitization therapy; first degree AV block; Prinzmetal\u2019s angina; peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with psoriasis or with a history of psoriasis should only be given beta-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) after a careful balancing of benefits and risks. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the anesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw beta blocker therapy before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours before anesthesia.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric use: The usual doses can be administered to elderly people; however, caution is advised when the dose is increased.\r Pediatric use: The safety and efficacy of Bisoprolol fumarate/amlodipine in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available.\r Patients with Liver disease: In case of hepatic impairment elimination of amlodipine may be elongated. Exact dosage recommendations concerning amlodipine have not been established, but the drug should therefore be administered with special caution in these patients. In case of severe hepatic impairment, the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg.\r Patients with Kidney disease: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Amlodipine should be administered with particular caution to patients undergoing dialysis. In case of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg\rOverdose Effects\rMost common signs expected with overdose of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, acute cardiac insufficiency, hypoglycemia. According to available data gross overdose of amlodipine could result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. In general, if overdose occurs, discontinuation of treatment and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-hypertensive\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place, below 30\u00b0C.

The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a \u03b21-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rBetacor HZ drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Betacor HZ drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Betacor HZ drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Betacor HZ drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Betacor HZ therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Betacor HZ product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betacor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of Betacor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Betacor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Betacor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r\n \nGeriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r\n* \u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betacor should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r\n \nCatecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of Betacor may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r\n \nCentrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r\n \nAntiarrhythmic Agents: Betacor should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r\n \nCalcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\r\nContraindications\r\nIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Betacor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rNoclog Plus is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNoclog Plus may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Noclog Plus.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms.

Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol & Amlodipine combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with the individual products given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination, but as separate tablets\rPharmacology\rThis consists of Amlodipine and Bisoprolol Fumarate. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet once daily in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with separately administered monocomponent products of the same doses as the recommended fixed-dose combination.\r Interaction\rCombinations not recommended: Calcium antagonists of the verapamil and diltiazem type, centrally-acting antihypertensive drugs.\r Combinations to be used with caution: Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, simvastatin, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, parasympathomimetic drugs, topical beta-blockers (e.g. eye drops), insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs, anesthetic agents, digitalis glycosides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sympathomimetic agents, antihypertensive agents and other drugs with blood pressure lowering potential.\r Combinations to be considered: Mefloquine, Rifampicin, Ergotamine derivatives, MAO inhibitors (except MAO-B inhibitor).\rContraindications\rAcute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation, obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis), cardiogenic shock, second or third degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, sinoatrial block, symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, severe bronchial asthma, severe forms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease or severe forms of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, untreated phaeochromocytoma metabolic acidosis, hypersensitivity to bisoprolol, amlodipine, dihydropyridine derivates or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Dizziness, headache, somnolence, palpitations, flushing, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain; edema (e.g. ankle edema), fatigue.\r Uncommon: Insomnia, mood changes (incl. anxiety), depression, sleep disorders, hypaesthesia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, tremor, visual disturbances (incl. diplopia), tinnitus, AV conduction disturbances, worsening of pre existing heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, dyspnea, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma or a history of obstructive airway disease, rhinitis, dyspepsia, dry mouth, alopecia, purpura, skin discoloration, pruritus, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle cramps, back pain, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakisuria, potency disorders, gynecomastia, asthenia, chest pain, pain, malaise, weight increase, weight decrease.\r Rare: Allergic reactions mainly affecting the skin, nightmares, hallucinations, confusion, decreased tear secretion, hearing disorders, allergic rhinitis, hepatitis, increased triglycerides, increased liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with heart failure should be treated with caution. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function cannot be excluded. Since the abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to a transitory worsening of the clinical condition, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, the treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Caution is advised in patients with impaired hepatic function. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with obstructive airways diseases unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Due to the bisoprolol component treatment must be used with caution in: bronchospasm (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease; concomitant bronchodilating therapy may be recommended); diabetes mellitus showing large fluctuations in blood glucose values, symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked; strict fasting; ongoing desensitization therapy; first degree AV block; Prinzmetal\u2019s angina; peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with psoriasis or with a history of psoriasis should only be given beta-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) after a careful balancing of benefits and risks. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the anesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw beta blocker therapy before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours before anesthesia.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric use: The usual doses can be administered to elderly people; however, caution is advised when the dose is increased.\r Pediatric use: The safety and efficacy of Bisoprolol fumarate/amlodipine in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available.\r Patients with Liver disease: In case of hepatic impairment elimination of amlodipine may be elongated. Exact dosage recommendations concerning amlodipine have not been established, but the drug should therefore be administered with special caution in these patients. In case of severe hepatic impairment, the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg.\r Patients with Kidney disease: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Amlodipine should be administered with particular caution to patients undergoing dialysis. In case of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg\rOverdose Effects\rMost common signs expected with overdose of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, acute cardiac insufficiency, hypoglycemia. According to available data gross overdose of amlodipine could result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. In general, if overdose occurs, discontinuation of treatment and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-hypertensive\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place, below 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rLosan Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30\u00b0C. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nLosan Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\r\nDosage\r\nHypertension-\r\nThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\r\nFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\r\nA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\r\nIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks.

If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Myocard fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Myocard in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg.

Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Orabis in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

It displays highest level of affinity for the \u00df1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks \u00df1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by \u00df-blockers, in patients with non-\u00df1 selective \u00df1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r\n \nThe pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r\n \nAbsorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r\n \nMetabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r\n \nElimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r\n \nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r\n \nPatients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmezest is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmezest was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmezest is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmezest and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmezest has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmezest was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmezest and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmezest and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmezest (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmezest. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmezest.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmezest. The most likely effects of Olmezest overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmezest requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Olmezest AM drug is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient\u2019s risk.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rOlmedip - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.\r Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).\rDosage & Administration\rSubstitute individually titrated components for patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil. This combination may also be given with increased amounts of Amlodipine, Olmesartan Medoxomil, or both, as needed.\r Initial therapy: Initiate with 5/20 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to a maximum of 10/40 mg once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rOlmezest is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olmezest was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olmezest is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmezest and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlmezest has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmezest was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmezest and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmezest and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmezest (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmezest. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmezest.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olmezest. The most likely effects of Olmezest overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmezest requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olmezest and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olmezest may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nOlmezest has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olmezest was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olmezest and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olmezest and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olmezest, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olmezest (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olmezest. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olmezest.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Olmezest. The most likely effects of Olmezest overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olmezest requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rClopilet A is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rClopilet A may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Clopilet A.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Clopilet A or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.\rPharmacology\rVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.\r Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Glucomin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, this combination may be initiated at twice daily, 1 tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. Taking this combination with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when Vildagliptin (100 mg once daily) was co-administered with Metformin Hydrochloride (1,000 mg once daily). Vildagliptin has a low potential for drug interactions. Since Vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate nor does it inhibit nor induces CYP 450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with co-medications that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. As a result of these studies no clinically relevant interactions with other oral antidiabetics (glibenclamide, pioglitazone, metformin hydrochloride), amlodipine, digoxin, ramipril, simvastatin, valsartan or warfarin were observed after co-administration with vildagliptin. On the other hand, furosemide, nifedipine and glyburide increase Cmax and blood AUC of Metformin with no change in renal clearance of Metformin.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are headache, tremor, dizziness, nausea, hypoglycaemia etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women and therefore, this combination should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. No studies have been conducted with the components of this combination. As it is not known whether Vildagliptin and/or Metformin Hydrochloride is excreted in human milk this combination should not be administered to breast-feeding women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. Serum creatinine should be monitored at least once a year in patients with normal renal function and 2\u20134 times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limit of normal and in elderly patients. Special caution should be exercised in elderly patients where renal function may become impaired (e.g. when initiating antihypertensives, diuretics or NSAIDs). It is recommended that Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are monitored prior to initiation of Vildapin Plus, at three-monthly intervals in the first year and periodically thereafter. If transaminase levels are increased, patients should be monitored with a second liver function evaluation to confirm the finding and be followed thereafter with frequent liver function tests until the abnormality return to normal. If AST or ALT persist at 3 x ULN, Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be stopped Patients who develop jaundice or other signs of liver dysfunction. Following withdrawal of treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin and LFT normalization, treatment with Vildagliptin & Metformin should not be reinitiated. Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of Vildapin Plus in pediatric patients have not been established. Therefore, Vildapin Plus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.\r Use in geriatric patients: As Metformin is excreted via the kidney, and elderly patients have a tendency to decreased renal function, elderly patients taking Vildapin Plus should have their renal function monitored regularly. Vildapin Plus should only be used in elderly patients with normal renal function.\r Patients with renal impairment: Vildapin Plus should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dl (>135 micro mol/L) in males and > 1.4 mg/dl (>110 micro mol/L) in females.\r Patients with hepatic impairment: Vildapin Plus is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST >3 X the upper limit of normal.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombination Oral hypoglycemic preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nThis tablet is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercises to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose diabetes is not adequately controlled on Metformin Hydrochloride or Vildagliptin alone or who are already treated with the combination of Vildagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, as separate tablets.\r\nPharmacology\r\nVildagliptin acts primarily by inhibiting DPP-4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase-4), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). The administration of Vildagliptin results in a rapid and complete inhibition of DPP-4 activity resulting in increased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. By increasing the endogenous levels of these incretin hormones, Vildagliptin increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and decreases glucagon secretion from alpha cell. The enhanced increase in the insulin/glucagon ratio during hyperglycaemia due to increased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, leading to reduced glycaemia.\r\n \nMetformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol & Amlodipine combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with the individual products given concurrently at the same dose level as in the combination, but as separate tablets\rPharmacology\rThis consists of Amlodipine and Bisoprolol Fumarate. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine acts directly on vessels to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Bisoprolol Fumarate is a synthetic, beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic and relevant membrane stabilizing activity. It only shows low affinity to the beta2 receptor of the smooth muscles of bronchi and vessels as well as to the beta2-receptors concerned with metabolic regulation. Therefore, bisoprolol is generally not to be expected to influence airway resistance and beta2-mediated metabolic effects. Its beta1-selectivity extends beyond the therapeutic dose range.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet once daily in patients whose blood pressure is adequately controlled with separately administered monocomponent products of the same doses as the recommended fixed-dose combination.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rCombinations not recommended: Calcium antagonists of the verapamil and diltiazem type, centrally-acting antihypertensive drugs.\r Combinations to be used with caution: Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, simvastatin, Tacrolimus, Cyclosporine, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, parasympathomimetic drugs, topical beta-blockers (e.g. eye drops), insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs, anesthetic agents, digitalis glycosides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sympathomimetic agents, antihypertensive agents and other drugs with blood pressure lowering potential.\r Combinations to be considered: Mefloquine, Rifampicin, Ergotamine derivatives, MAO inhibitors (except MAO-B inhibitor).\rContraindications\rAcute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation, obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis), cardiogenic shock, second or third degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, sinoatrial block, symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, severe bronchial asthma, severe forms of peripheral arterial occlusive disease or severe forms of Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, untreated phaeochromocytoma metabolic acidosis, hypersensitivity to bisoprolol, amlodipine, dihydropyridine derivates or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Dizziness, headache, somnolence, palpitations, flushing, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain; edema (e.g. ankle edema), fatigue.\r Uncommon: Insomnia, mood changes (incl. anxiety), depression, sleep disorders, hypaesthesia, paresthesia, dysgeusia, tremor, visual disturbances (incl. diplopia), tinnitus, AV conduction disturbances, worsening of pre existing heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, dyspnea, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma or a history of obstructive airway disease, rhinitis, dyspepsia, dry mouth, alopecia, purpura, skin discoloration, pruritus, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, muscular weakness, muscle cramps, back pain, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakisuria, potency disorders, gynecomastia, asthenia, chest pain, pain, malaise, weight increase, weight decrease.\r Rare: Allergic reactions mainly affecting the skin, nightmares, hallucinations, confusion, decreased tear secretion, hearing disorders, allergic rhinitis, hepatitis, increased triglycerides, increased liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Not recommended.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with heart failure should be treated with caution. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function cannot be excluded. Since the abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to a transitory worsening of the clinical condition, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, the treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Caution is advised in patients with impaired hepatic function. Beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with obstructive airways diseases unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Due to the bisoprolol component treatment must be used with caution in: bronchospasm (bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease; concomitant bronchodilating therapy may be recommended); diabetes mellitus showing large fluctuations in blood glucose values, symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked; strict fasting; ongoing desensitization therapy; first degree AV block; Prinzmetal\u2019s angina; peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with psoriasis or with a history of psoriasis should only be given beta-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) after a careful balancing of benefits and risks. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked. In patients undergoing general anesthesia, the anesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw beta blocker therapy before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours before anesthesia.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric use: The usual doses can be administered to elderly people; however, caution is advised when the dose is increased.\r Pediatric use: The safety and efficacy of Bisoprolol fumarate/amlodipine in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available.\r Patients with Liver disease: In case of hepatic impairment elimination of amlodipine may be elongated. Exact dosage recommendations concerning amlodipine have not been established, but the drug should therefore be administered with special caution in these patients. In case of severe hepatic impairment, the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg.\r Patients with Kidney disease: No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Amlodipine should be administered with particular caution to patients undergoing dialysis. In case of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) the daily dose of bisoprolol must not exceed 10 mg\rOverdose Effects\rMost common signs expected with overdose of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, acute cardiac insufficiency, hypoglycemia. According to available data gross overdose of amlodipine could result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. In general, if overdose occurs, discontinuation of treatment and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-hypertensive\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place, below 30\u00b0C.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel.

Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rPladex-A is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPladex-A may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Pladex-A.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms.

Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye\u2019s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30\u00baC), protected from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r\n \nRecent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r\n \nAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r\n \nAbsorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\r\nof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\r\nAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r\n \nMetabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel.

        "description": "Indications\rOlsart is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Olsart was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Olsart is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olsart, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Olsart and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Olsart may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOlsart has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Olsart was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Olsart and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Olsart and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Olsart and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Olsart, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Olsart (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Olsart. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Olsart.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Olsart. The most likely effects of Olsart overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Olsart requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rOther \u03b2-blocking Agents: Betafix fumarate should not be combined with other \u03b2-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added \u03b2-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: \u03b2-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the \u03b2-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by \u03b2-blocker therapy, the introduction of \u03b2-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Betafix fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of \u03b2-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Betafix in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.

        "description": "Indications\rDisys is indicated:\rFor hypertension\rTo reduce hospitalizations in patients with congestive heart failure\rTo reduce death in patients who developed congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction\rPharmacology\rValsartan is an oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). It is orally active and specific angiotensin II antagonist acting on the AT1 subtype. Angiotensin's attachment to the receptors cause the blood vessels to narrow (vasoconstrict) which leads to an increase in blood pressure (hypertension). Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor. By blocking the action of angiotensin, Valsartan dilates blood vessels and reduces blood pressure without affecting pulse rate. Valsartan has much greater affinity (about 20,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. It does not bind or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\rDosage\rHypertension: The usual dose of Valsartan is 80 to 160 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 320 mg daily. Maximum blood pressure reduction occurs within 4 weeks. \r Heart failure: The usual dose is 40 mg twice daily and may be increased to 80-160 mg twice daily. \r Post-Myocardial Infarction: The initial dose after myocardial infarction is 20 mg twice daily. The dose should be increased with a target of 160 mg daily if tolerated without side effects.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rAdministration\rAdministration of Valsartan with food decreases the absorption of Valsartan by about 40%, so it should be taken on an empty stomach. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients with mild to moderate renal and hepatic insufficiency.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo drug interactions of clinical significance have been found. Compounds which have been studied in clinical trials include Cimetidine, Warfarin, Furosemide, Digoxin, Atenolol, Indomethacin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Amlodipine and Glibenclamide\r As Disys is not metabolized to a significant extent, clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in the form of metabolic induction or inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system are not expected with Disys. Although Disys is highly bound to plasma proteins, in vitrostudies have not shown any interaction at this level with a range of molecules which are also highly protein bound, such as Diclofenac, Furosemide, and Warfarin. Concomitant use of potassium sparing diuretics (e.g., Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride) potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. If co medication is considered necessary, caution is advisable\rContraindications\rValsartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rDisys is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. The most common side effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea and nausea. Patient may also experience hyperkalemia, impotency, reduced renal function, allergic reactions, dyspnea, constipation, back pain, muscle cramps, rash, anxiety, insomnia and vertigo. Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Disys.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r Nursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Disys is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r Impaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of Disys was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some elderly persons cannot be ruled out.\r Hepatic Impairment:\rMild to moderate: Max: 80 mg once daily.\rSevere: Contraindicated.\rOverdose Effects\rLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore between 15-30\u00b0 C.

Hypotension may also occur if patient have been taking diuretics along with Disys.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Valsartan should not be used in pregnancy, as in 2nd and 3rd trimester it can cause injury and even death to fetus. When pregnancy is detected, Valsartan should be stopped as soon as possible.\r\n \nNursing mothers: It is not known whether Valsartan is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nImpaired Hepatic Function: As the majority of Disys is eliminated in the bile, care should be exercised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment including biliary obstructive disorder.\r\n \nImpaired Renal Function: Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be required with patients having pre-existing renal impairment.\r\n \nHeart Failure and Myocardial Infarction: Caution should be exercised when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure and post-myocardial infarction patients.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n \nGeriatric use: No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of Disys was observed in this patient population, but greater sensitivity of some elderly persons cannot be ruled out.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment:\r\nMild to moderate: Max: 80 mg once daily.\r\nSevere: Contraindicated.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLimited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia, bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, has to be given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore between 15-30\u00b0 C. Protect from moisture and heat.",

Rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, Rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.\rDosage & Administration\rHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age): The usual dose range of Rosuvastatin is 5-20 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r Very High Cholesterol and High Risk of Ml or Stroke: 40 mg once daily.\r Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The recommended starting dose of Rosuvastatin is 20 mg once daily. Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL-C levels.\r Dosage in Asian Patients: Initiation of Rosuvastatin therapy with 5 mg once daily should be considered for Asian patients\r Use with Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Atazanavir/Ritonavir: In patients taking Cyclosporine, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 5 mg once daily. In patients taking a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir or Atazanavir and Ritonavir, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Niacin or Fenofibrate; a reduction in Rosuvastatin dosage should be considered in this setting. Combination therapy with Gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in Rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant use; if Rosuvastatin is used in combination with Gemfibrozil, the dose of Rosuvastatin should be limited to 10 mg once daily.\r Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: For patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr<30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of Rosuvastatin should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rRemarkable drug interactions of Rovast are-\rCyclosporine: Combination increases Rovast exposure.

The most frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rovast were headache, myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRosuvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy should be discontinued immediately. It is not known whether Rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRovast should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age >65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with Rovast may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (Fibrates or Niacin), Gemfibrozil, Cyclosporine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, or Atazanavir/Ritonavir. Rovast therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatinine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rovast therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before and at 12 weeks following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., semiannually) thereafter.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required.

        "description": "Indications\rRansys is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Ransys was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Ransys is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Ransys and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rRansys has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Ransys was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Ransys and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Ransys and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Ransys (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Ransys. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Ransys.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Ransys. The most likely effects of Ransys overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Ransys requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30\u00baC, protect from light & moisture.

It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r\n \nNo initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r\n \nPaediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Ransys was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Ransys is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Ransys and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Ransys may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRansys has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Ransys was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Ransys and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Ransys and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r\n \nThe following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Ransys, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Ransys (0.9%) patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible.

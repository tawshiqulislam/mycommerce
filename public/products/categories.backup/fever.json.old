Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Napa overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Napa levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Napa are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Napa to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa-containing products concurrently. Napa should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Napa overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Napa Extend to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa Extend-containing products concurrently. Napa Extend should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa Extend. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa Extend may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Napa Extend overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa Extend overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa Extend concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa Extend. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated for-\rThe management of moderate to moderately severe pain in adults.\rThe short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to \u03bc-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to \u03bc-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.\rDosage & Administration\rFor the management of moderate to moderately severe pain: The recommended dose is 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r In case of short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain: The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r This tablet can be administered without regard to food.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rContraindications\rTramadol & Paracetamol combination tablets should not be administered to patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol, paracetamol, any other component of this product, or opioids.

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\r\n \nTramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to \u03bc-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to \u03bc-opioid receptors. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics.These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor the management of moderate to moderately severe pain: The recommended dose is 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r\n \nIn case of short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain: The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.\r\n \nThis tablet can be administered without regard to food.\r\n* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\r\nContraindications\r\nTramadol & Paracetamol combination tablets should not be administered to patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol, paracetamol, any other component of this product, or opioids.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Napa overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Napa levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Napa are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Napa to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa-containing products concurrently. Napa should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Napa overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Ace XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Ace XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace XR-containing products concurrently. Ace XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\rAce - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\rChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Renova XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Renova XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Renova XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Renova XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Renova XR-containing products concurrently. Renova XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Renova XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Renova XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Renova XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Tamen XR overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Tamen XR levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Tamen XR are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Tamen XR to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Tamen XR-containing products concurrently. Tamen XR should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Tamen XR. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Tamen XR may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Tamen XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Tamen XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Tamen XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Tamen XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Tamen to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Tamen-containing products concurrently. Tamen should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Tamen. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Tamen may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Tamen overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Tamen overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Tamen concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Tamen. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Napa overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Napa levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Napa are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Napa to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa-containing products concurrently. Napa should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Napa overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Napa overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Napa levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Napa are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Napa to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa-containing products concurrently. Napa should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Napa overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rProfen oral dosage form is indicated in Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Gouty arthritis, Juvenile polyarthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Synovitis, Low back pain, Dysmenorrhoea, Fever, Migraine, Soft tissue injuries, Pain & Inflammation in dental and musculoskeletal origin.\r Profen topical gel contains Profen and belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medicines reduce pain and inflammation and bring down a high temperature. Profen 5% gel is used to treat a number of painful conditions affecting the joints and muscles, such as backache, rheumatic and muscular pain, sprains, strains and sports injuries. It is also used to treat pain from non-serious arthritic conditions and nerve pain (neuralgia).\rPharmacology\rIbuprofen has a high level of anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic activity. The analgesic effects of Ibuprofen are due to both a peripheral and a central effect. Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which thus results in a marked reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen also inhibits the synthesis of some lipo-oxygenase products. Ibuprofen thus quickly relieves pain and stiffness, reduces swelling, and improves the movement of different joints of arthritis sufferers.\rDosage & Administration\rOral dosage form:\r Adults: The dose is initially, 400 mg 3 times daily. A dose of 2400 mg daily should not be exceeded.\r Children:\r3-6 months (body-weight over 5 kg): \u00bd tsp (2.5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r6 months-1 year: \u00bd tsp (2.5 ml) 3-4 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r1-4 years: 1 tsp (5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r4-7 years: 1\u00bd tsp (7.5 ml) 3 times daily; max. 30 mg/kg daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r7-10 years: 2 tsp (10 ml) 3 times daily; upto 30 mg/kg (max. 2.4 gm) daily in 3-4 divided doses.\r10-12 years: 3 tsp (15 ml) 3 times daily; upto 30 mg/kg (max. 2.4 gm) daily in 3-4 divided doses.\rchildren weighing less than 5 kg: Not recommended for children weighing less than 5 kg.\r In juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: up to 30-40 mg/kg of body weight daily in 3-4 divided doses may be taken or as directed by the physician.\r  Topical gel:\r Adults: Squeeze 4 to 10cm (i.e. 1.6 to 4 inches) of gel from the tube on affected area. Massage until absorbed. This dose should not be repeated more frequently than every four hours and no more than four times a day in any 24 hour period. The amount of gel squeezed would be equivalent to 50 to 125 mg of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen 5% gel should only be used on healthy, unbroken skin. Do not use it on or near cuts or grazes or under dressings such as plasters. Also, do not use it on the genital area. Do not let any gel come in contact with your eyes. If it does, rinse your eyes with cold water and consult your doctor. Hands should be washed after applying Ibuprofen 5% gel, unless they are the site of treatment. If the condition does not improve after two weeks use, or becomes worse at any time, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.\r Use in children: Ibuprofen 5% gel is not recommended for use in children under 12 years.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rContraindications\rIbuprofen is contraindicated in patients who have shown the previous hypersensitivity to Ibuprofen, and in patients with severe or active peptic ulceration.\rSide Effects\rUpset stomach, vomiting, heartburn, nausea may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAdverse effects of Ibuprofen on the developing fetus cannot be fully excluded. Ibuprofen should not be used during pregnancy and for nursing mothers unless the potential benefits to the mothers outweigh the potential risks.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rProfen should be used with caution and the lowest effective doses should be given if there is a history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or ulcer. Patients on long-term therapy with Profen require ocular monitoring at regular intervals, as changes in ocular function have been reported. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are more likely than others to develop hypersensitivity to Profen.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Fast overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Fast levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Fast are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Fast to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Fast-containing products concurrently. Fast should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Fast. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Fast may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Fast overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Fast overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Fast concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Fast. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Napa Rapid (Actizorb) should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa Rapid (Actizorb). Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa Rapid (Actizorb) may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Napa Rapid (Actizorb) overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa Rapid (Actizorb) overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa Rapid (Actizorb) concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa Rapid (Actizorb). However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Napa overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Napa levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Napa are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Napa to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Napa-containing products concurrently. Napa should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Napa. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Napa may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Napa overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Napa overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Napa concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Napa. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rDyspeptic symptom complex, often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis:\rEpigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain\rEructation, flatulence, early satiety\rNausea and vomiting\rHeartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth\rNon-ulcer dyspepsia\rAcute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine.\r Parkinson's disease: In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting.\r Radiological studies: Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.\rItokine - MedEx campaign banner\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDomperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.\rDosage & Administration\rDomperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring.\r The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily.\rChildren: 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn dyspeptic symptom:\rAdults: 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily.\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily.\rIn acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting):\rAdults: 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily\rChildren: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks).\rBy rectum in suppositories:\rAdults (including elderly): 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours.\rChildren: The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary.\rThe maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.\r* \u099a\u09bf\u0995\u09bf\u09ce\u09b8\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09cd\u09b6 \u09ae\u09cb\u09a4\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u0994\u09b7\u09a7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09ac\u09a8 \u0995\u09b0\u09c1\u09a8'\rInteraction\rConcomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs may antagonise the antidyspeptic effect of domperidone: Antacids and antisecretory drugs should not be given simultaneously with domperidone as they lower its oral bioavailability. The main metabolic pathway of domperidone is through CYP3A4. In vitro data suggest that the concomitant use of drugs that significantly inhibit this enzyme may result in increased plasma levels of domperidone. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors include: azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics. HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, etc. Theoretically, since domperidone has gastro-kinetic effects it could influence the absorption of concomitantly orally administered drugs, particularly those with sustained release or enteric coated formulations. However, in patients already stabilised on digoxin or paracetamol, concomitant administration of domperidone did not influence the blood levels of these drugs.\rneuroleptics, the action of which it does not potentiate,\rdopaminergic agonists (bromocriptine, L-dopa), whose unwanted peripheral effects such as digestive disorders, nausea and vomiting it suppresses without counteracting their central properties.\rContraindications\rDomperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDomperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDeflux Meltab should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in infants: Because the metabolic and blood-brain barrier functions are not fully developed during the first months of life, any drug should only be given to infants with great caution and under close medical supervision. Since the typical absence of neurological side effects with domperidone is mainly due to its poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier, the possible occurrence of such effects cannot be totally excluded in infants under 1 year of age. Use in liver disorders: Since domperidone is highly metabolised in the liver, domperidone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Use in kidney disorders: In patients with severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >6 mg/100ml, i.e. >O.6 mmol/I) the elimination half-life of domperidone as increased from 7.4 to 20.8 hours, but plasma drug levels were lower than in healthy volunteers. Since very little unchanged drug is excreted via the kidneys, it is unlikely that the dose of a single acute administration needs to be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. However, on repeated administration, the dosing frequency should be reduced to once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the impairment, and the dose may need to be reduced. Generally, patients on prolonged therapy should be reviewed regularly.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rMotility Stimulants, Motility stimulants/Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30\u00b0C, Protected from light & moisture.

A great number of pharmacological studies have proved that Indomethacin has strong anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. Unlike the corticosteriods, the effect of Indomethacin is not related to the pituitary gland or the adrenals.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.\rPharmacology\rParacetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.\rAce - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rTablet:\rAdult: 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 gm (8 tablets) daily.\rChildren (6-12 years): \u00bd to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Longpara should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Longpara. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Longpara may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Longpara overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Longpara overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Longpara concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable).

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Ace overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Ace levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects of Ace are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCare is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r\n \nSymptoms: Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.\rDosage & Administration\rNaproxen oral preparations should be taken with water preferably after meals.\r Naproxen Enteric Coated Tablet: Adult:\rFor rheumatoid arthritis/ osteoarthritis/ ankylosing spondylitis: For adults 500-1000 mg per day taken in two devided doses at 12- hour intervals.

It should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\rSide Effects\rMost frequently reported side effects include following:\rGastrointestinal: Heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia.\rCentral Nervous System: Headache, vertigo, drowsiness.\rDermatological: Pruritus (itching), purpura.\rCardiovascular: Edema, palpitation.\rOthers: Visual disturbances, hearing disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMost non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have an adverse effect on the fetus through their pharmacological properties. Naproxen causes a delay in parturition in animals and has been associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and severe pulmonary hypertension in infants born to mothers taking Naproxen. The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers. The amount of Naproxen distributed into breast milk is considered by some authorities to be too small to be harmful to a breast-fed infant although some manufacturers recommend that breast feeding should be avoided during Naproxen therapy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal effects: As with other non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, long-term administration of naproxen to animal has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other abnormal renal pathology. In humans, there have been reports of acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome associated with Napro-A-containing products and others NSAIDs since they have been marketed. Napro-A and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, the drug should be used with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function, and the monitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients. Caution should be used if the drug is given to the patients with creatinine clearance of less than 20ml/min because accumulation of naproxen metabolites has been seen in such patients.\r Hepatic effects: There have been a few reports of moderate to severe jaundice attributed to Napro-A.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Osteoarthritis, Drugs used for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30\u00b0C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Alcohol can increase the hepatotoxicity of Renova overdosage. Chronic ingestion of anticonvulsants or oral steroid contraceptives induce liver enzymes and may prevent attainment of therapeutic Renova levels by increasing first-pass metabolism or clearance.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Paracetamol.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of Renova are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rEpidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare is advised in the administration of Renova to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Renova-containing products concurrently. Renova should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary.\rOverdose Effects\rLiver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Renova. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Renova may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John\u2019s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia.\r Symptoms: Symptoms of Renova overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Renova overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Renova concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Renova. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon opioid analgesics\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic.

        "description": "PRESENTATION\r Beuflox-D Sterile Ophthalmic/Otic Suspension: Each ml contains Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride BP equivalent to Ciprofloxacin 3 mg &\rDexamethasone BP 1 mg.\r  DESCRIPTION\r Beuflox-D is a combination preparation of Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone. Ciprofloxacin is fluoroquinolone antimicrobial and\rDexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid. The combination effectively resolves inflammation and infection in severe eye or ear\rconditions.\r  INDICATIONS\r Eye\r It is indicated for the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions where bacterial infections or a risk of\rbacterial ocular infections exist. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of\rinfection is high or where is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eyes. The\rcombination can also be used for post-operative inflammation and any other ocular inflammation associated with infection.\r Ear\r It is indicated for the treatment of ear infections accompanied by inflammation such as otitis externa, otitis media and Chronic\rsuppurative otitis media etc. The combination can also be used for post-operative inflammation of ear.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Eye:\rCorneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcer is two drops into the affected eye every 15\rminutes for the first six hours and then two drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On\rthe second day, instill two drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place two drops in the\raffected eye every four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.\rBacterial Conjunctivitis:\rThe recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is one or two drops instilled into the conjunctival\rsac(s) every two hours while awake for two days and one or two drops every four hours while awake for the next five days.\rEar:\rFour drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days. The suspension should be warmed by holding the bottle in\rthe hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness, which may result from the instillation of a cold suspension. The patient\rshould lie with the affected ear upward, and then the suspension should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 60\rseconds. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.\rPaediatric Use:\rEar: Safety and effectiveness of this suspension in pediatric (6 months of age and older) patients for ear application have been\restablished.\rEye:\rSafety and effectiveness of this suspension in pediatric patients for eye application have not been established.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Side Effects\rThe most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions seen with Ciprofloxacin are transient ocular burning or discomfort.\rOther reported reactions include stinging, redness, itching, periocular/facial edema, foreign body sensation, photophobia, blurred\rvision, tearing, dryness and eye pain. Rare reports of dizziness have been received.\r The reactions due to the steroid component are elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and\rinfrequent optic nerve damage, posterior sub-capsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing.\r   PRECAUTIONS\r Shake the bottle well before use. Prolonged use of Ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including\rfungi. Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma.The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered\rafter long-term steroid dosing. Patients-wearing contact lenses must not use the drops during time the lenses are worn.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy\rBeuflox-D should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation\rIt is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids would result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce\rdetectable quantities in human milk. It is also not known whether Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk following topical\rophthalmic administration. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when the combination is\radministered to a nursing woman.\r   OVER DOSE\r A topical overdose may be flushed from the eye(s) with warm water.\r  STORAGE\r Store in a cool, dry place and protect from light.\rKeep out of the reach of children.\rProtect from freezing.\rShake well before using.\r   COMMERCIAL PACK\r Beuflox-D Sterile Ophthalmic/Otic Suspension: Plastic dropper bottle containing 5 ml sterile Ophthalmic/Otic Suspension.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nBeuflox-D Sterile Ophthalmic/Otic Suspension: Each ml contains Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride BP equivalent to Ciprofloxacin 3 mg &\r\nDexamethasone BP 1 mg.\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nBeuflox-D is a combination preparation of Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone.

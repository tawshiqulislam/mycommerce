        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome. It is useful in relieving many of the symptoms of parkinsonism, particularly rigidity and bradykinesia. This tablet is frequently helpful in the management of tremor, dysphagia, sialorrhea and postural instability associated with Parkinson's disease and syndrome. Levodopa plus carbidopa before physiotherapy increases motor recovery after stroke.\rDescription\rLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of Levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more Levodopa becomes available to the brain.\rDosage & Administration\rIf 100/10 mg tablet is used: Dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. Titration upward may be required in some patients to achieve optimum dosage of carbidopa. The dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (two tablets q.d.s.) is reached.\r For patients starting with 250/25 mg tablet: The initial dose is one half taken once or twice daily. However, this may not provide the optimal amount of Carbidopa needed by many patients. If necessary, add one-half every day or every other day until optimal response is reached. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of Levodopa a day is one tablet of 250/25 mg three or four times a day.\r Maintenance dose: Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. When more levodopa is requried, 250/25 mg tablet should be substituted at a dosage of one tablet three or four times a day. If necessary, the dosage of 250/25 mg tablet may be increased by half to one tablet every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with a total daily dosage greater than 200 mg Carbidopa is limited.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when Carbidopa-Levodopa is added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive medicines. Therefore, when therapy with CarbidopaLevodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive medicine may be required. There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and Carbidopa-Levodopa. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of Carbidopa and/or Levodopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate. Dopamine-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones and risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of Levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of Levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicines with Carbidopa-Levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and Carbidopa-Levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to Carbidopa-Levodopa alone.\rContraindications\rCarbidopa-Levodopa tablet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Carbidopa and Levodopa, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Since Levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Carbidopa-Levodopa should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects that occur frequently in patients receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa are those due to the central neuropharmacologic activity of dopamine. These reactions usually can be diminished by dosage reduction. The most common adverse effects are dyskinesias including choreiform, dystonic, and other involuntary movements and nausea.\rBody as a whole: syncope, chest pain, anorexia.\rCardiovascular: palpitation, orthostatic effects including hypotensive episodes, hypertension, phlebitis.\rGastrointestinal: vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, diarrhoea, dark saliva.\rHaemotologic: leukopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\rHypersensitivity: angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\rNervous System: dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia, delusions, hallucinations and paranoid ideation, depression with or without development of suicidal tendencies, dementia, dream abnormalities, agitation, confusion, increased libido.\rRespiratory: dyspnea.\rSkin: alopecia, rash, dark sweat.\rUrogenital: dark urine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough the effects of CarbidopaLevodopa on human pregnancy are unknown both Levodopa and combinations of Carbidopa and Levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. Therefore, use of CarbidopaLevodopa in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the medicine be weighed against possible hazards should pregnancy occur. It is not known whether Carbidopa is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Carbidopa Levodopa may be given to patients already taking Levodopa alone; however, the Levodopa must be discontinued at least 12 hours before Carbidopa-Levodopa started. Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with Levodopa alone because Carbidopa permits more Levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Carbidopa-Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions.\r Care should be exercised to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have atriai, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with Carbidopa-Levodopa, provided the intraocular pressure is weli controlled and the patient monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Carbidopa-Levodopa in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 years is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome.

        "description": "PRESENTATION\r Quiet 25: Each film coated tablet contains Quetiapine Fumarate USP equivalent to Quetiapine 25 mg.\r Quiet 50 XR: Each extended release tablet contains Quetiapine Fumarate USP equivalent to Quetiapine 50 mg.\r Quiet 100: Each film coated tablet contains Quetiapine Fumarate USP equivalent to Quetiapine 100 mg.\r Quiet 200 XR: Each extended release tablet contains Quetiapine Fumarate USP equivalent to Quetiapine 200 mg.\r Quiet 300 XR: Each extended release tablet contains Quetiapine Fumarate USP equivalent to Quetiapine 300 mg.\r  DESCRIPTION\r Quetiapine Fumarate is an atypical psychotropic agent belonging to a chemical class, the dibenzothiazepine derivatives. Quetiapine\ris an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1 ,\rand adrenergic a1 and a2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rThe mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is\rmediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may\rexplain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rElimination of Quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours. Steady-state\rconcentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of\rdrugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Quetiapine Fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak\rplasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of\rQuetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively. It\ris 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Following a single oral dose less than 1% of the administered dose\ris excreted as unchanged drug. Approximately 73% and 20% of the doses were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.\rQuetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver.\r  INDICATIONS\r Bipolar Mania: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, as either\rmonotherapy or adjunct therapy to\r lithium or divalproex.\r Schizophrenia: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Physician who elects to use Quetiapine for extended\rperiods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r • Schizophrenia-Adults\rInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 300 mg/day Dose increases can be made at intervals as short as 1 day and in increments of up to\r300 mg/day\rRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r• Schizophrenia- Adolescents (13 to 17 years)\rInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 50 mg/day; Day 2: 100 mg/day; Day 3: 200 mg/day; Day 4: 300 mg/day; Day 5: 400 mg/day\rRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r • Bipolar Mania- Acute monotherapy or as an adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex\rInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 300 mg/day; Day 2: 600 mg/day; Day 3: 400-800 mg/day\rRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r • Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder\rInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 50 mg/day; Day 2: 100 mg/day; Day 3: 200 mg/day; Day 4: 300 mg/day\rRecommended dose: 300 mg/day\r • Major Depressive Disorder, Adjunctive therapy with Antidepressants\rInitial dose and titration: Day 1 & 2: 50 mg/day; Day 3 & 4: 150 mg/day\rRecommended dose: 150-300 mg/day\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, postural hypotension, elevated ALT (SGPT) levels, weight gain\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia. Hypotension and syncope, especially during the initial dose titration period.\rConduct eye examinations prior to or shortly after starting Quetiapine and at 6-month intervals thereafter; discontinue the drug\rif clinically significant lens changes are observed. History of seizures. Hypothyroidism. Hyperprolactinemia. Antiemetic effect.\rSuicide. Use with great caution in moderate or severe hepatic impairments. Renal impairment, cardiovascular disease. Disruption of\rbody temperature regulation. Hyperglycemia. Lactation (avoid breast-feeding)\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women and Quetiapine should be used during\rpregnancy only if the potential\rbenefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\rNursing Mothers: It is recommended that women receiving Quetiapine should not breast feed.\rPediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of Quetiapine in pediatric patients less than 13 years with schizophrenia, less than\r10 years with bipolar mania and less than 18 years for bipolar depression have not been established.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r May enhance the effects of other centrally acting drugs, certain antihypertensive agents; may antagonize the effects of dopamine\ragonists and levodopa.

Quetiapine\r\nis an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1 ,\r\nand adrenergic a1 and a2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\r\nThe mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is\r\nmediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may\r\nexplain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\r\nElimination of Quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours. Steady-state\r\nconcentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of\r\ndrugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Quetiapine Fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak\r\nplasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of\r\nQuetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively. It\r\nis 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Following a single oral dose less than 1% of the administered dose\r\nis excreted as unchanged drug. Approximately 73% and 20% of the doses were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.\r\nQuetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver.\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nBipolar Mania: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, as either\r\nmonotherapy or adjunct therapy to\r\n \nlithium or divalproex.\r\n \nSchizophrenia: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Physician who elects to use Quetiapine for extended\r\nperiods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \n• Schizophrenia-Adults\r\nInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 300 mg/day Dose increases can be made at intervals as short as 1 day and in increments of up to\r\n300 mg/day\r\nRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r\n• Schizophrenia- Adolescents (13 to 17 years)\r\nInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 50 mg/day; Day 2: 100 mg/day; Day 3: 200 mg/day; Day 4: 300 mg/day; Day 5: 400 mg/day\r\nRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r\n \n• Bipolar Mania- Acute monotherapy or as an adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex\r\nInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 300 mg/day; Day 2: 600 mg/day; Day 3: 400-800 mg/day\r\nRecommended dose: 400-800 mg/day\r\n \n• Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar Disorder\r\nInitial dose and titration: Day 1: 50 mg/day; Day 2: 100 mg/day; Day 3: 200 mg/day; Day 4: 300 mg/day\r\nRecommended dose: 300 mg/day\r\n \n• Major Depressive Disorder, Adjunctive therapy with Antidepressants\r\nInitial dose and titration: Day 1 & 2: 50 mg/day; Day 3 & 4: 150 mg/day\r\nRecommended dose: 150-300 mg/day\r\n \n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nSomnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, postural hypotension, elevated ALT (SGPT) levels, weight gain\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Epitra in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epitra for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpitra does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epitra on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epitra are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epitra may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epitra may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epitra. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epitra in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epitra pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epitra might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epitra is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epitra.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Epitra (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epitra. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epitra infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Epitra in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epitra for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nEpitra does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epitra on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epitra are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epitra may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epitra may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epitra. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epitra in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epitra pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epitra might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epitra is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Nexcital should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r\n \nChildren and adolescents (<18 years): Nexcital should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r\n \nReduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r\n \nReduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r\n \nPoor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r\n \nWhen stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r\n \nManagement: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture. Keep the medicine out of the reach of children.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe depression associated with moderate to severe anxiety. Symptoms likely to respond in the first week of treatment include insomnia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety, suicidal ideation and anorexia.\rPharmacology\rAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and Chlordiazepoxide is an anxiolytic. Amitriptyline inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This interference with the reuptake is responsible for the antidepressant activity of Amitriptyline. Chlordiazepoxide works by enhancing GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative and anxiolytic effect.\rDosage & Administration\rOptimum dosage varies with the severity of the symptoms and the response of the individual patient. When a satisfactory response is obtained, the dosage should be reduced to the smallest amount needed to maintain the remission. The larger portion of the total daily dose may be taken at bedtime. In some patients, a single dose at bedtime may be sufficient. This tablet in an initial dosage of 3 or 4 tablets daily in divided doses is satisfactory. Or directed by the physican.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBecause of its Amitriptyline component, Reelife may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or compounds with a similar mechanism of action.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants. It should not be given concomitantly with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.\rSide Effects\rSide effects: Many symptoms common to the depressive state, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, restlessness and lethargy, have been reported as side effects of treatment with Reelife.\r Adverse reactions: Most frequently reported were drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness and bloating. Less commonly included vivid dreams, impotence, tremor, confusion and nasal congestion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafe use of this preparation during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse with caution in patients with a history of seizures. Close supervision is required when Reelife is given to hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication. The usual precautions should be observed when treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. All pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. Anyone considering the use of Chlordiazepoxide and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride Tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.\r Geriatric Use: In elderly and debilitated patients it is recommended that dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, over sedation, confusion or anticholinergic effects.\rOverdose Effects\rDeaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Critical manifestations of Amitriptyline overdose include cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions and CNS depression, including coma. Manifestations of benzodiazepine overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes.\r Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of Chlordiazepoxide. Generally, milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache and malaise) have also been reported in association with abrupt Amitriptyline discontinuation.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined anxiolytics & anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light. Keep all medicines out of reach of the children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe depression associated with moderate to severe anxiety. Symptoms likely to respond in the first week of treatment include insomnia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety, suicidal ideation and anorexia.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and Chlordiazepoxide is an anxiolytic. Amitriptyline inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This interference with the reuptake is responsible for the antidepressant activity of Amitriptyline. Chlordiazepoxide works by enhancing GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative and anxiolytic effect.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOptimum dosage varies with the severity of the symptoms and the response of the individual patient. When a satisfactory response is obtained, the dosage should be reduced to the smallest amount needed to maintain the remission. The larger portion of the total daily dose may be taken at bedtime. In some patients, a single dose at bedtime may be sufficient. This tablet in an initial dosage of 3 or 4 tablets daily in divided doses is satisfactory. Or directed by the physican.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nBecause of its Amitriptyline component, Reelife may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or compounds with a similar mechanism of action.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants. It should not be given concomitantly with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide effects: Many symptoms common to the depressive state, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, restlessness and lethargy, have been reported as side effects of treatment with Reelife.\r\n \nAdverse reactions: Most frequently reported were drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness and bloating. Less commonly included vivid dreams, impotence, tremor, confusion and nasal congestion.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafe use of this preparation during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse with caution in patients with a history of seizures. Close supervision is required when Reelife is given to hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication. The usual precautions should be observed when treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. All pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. Anyone considering the use of Chlordiazepoxide and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride Tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.\r\n \nGeriatric Use: In elderly and debilitated patients it is recommended that dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, over sedation, confusion or anticholinergic effects.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nDeaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Critical manifestations of Amitriptyline overdose include cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions and CNS depression, including coma. Manifestations of benzodiazepine overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes.\r\n \nWithdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of Chlordiazepoxide. Generally, milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache and malaise) have also been reported in association with abrupt Amitriptyline discontinuation.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined anxiolytics & anti-depressant drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.

        "description": "Indications\rUtromeg is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and urgency incontinence as may occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome.\rPharmacology\rMirabegron is the first beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist. Mirabegron exerts its effect via a dual mechanism, both directly acts on the bladder smooth muscle and also via the sensory nervous system, it increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and leads to relaxation of the detrusor smooth muscle during storage phase of urinary bladder fill-void cycle by activation of beta-3 adrenoceptor which increase bladder capacity.\rDosage\rAdults including elderly: The recommended starting dose is Mirabegron 25 mg tablet once daily with or without food. Based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to Mirabegron 50 mg tablet once daily.\r Renal or hepatic impairment:\rPatients with severe renal impairment (ClCr 15 to 29 mL/min or eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the daily dose of Mirabegron should not exceed 25 mg tablet once daily.\rMirabegron has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis) or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) and it is therefore not recommended for use in these patient populations.\rGender: No dose adjustment is necessary according to gender.\r Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Mirabegron in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rMirabegron tablet is to be taken once daily, with liquids, swallowed whole and is not to be chewed, divided, or crushed.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEffect of enzyme inhibitors: Utromeg exposure (AUC) was increased 1.8-fold in the presence of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A/P-gp ketoconazole in healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment is needed when Utromeg is combined with inhibitors of CYP3A and/or P-gp. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir and clarithromycin, the recommended dose is 25 mg once daily with or without food. Utromeg is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or patients with moderate hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r Effect of enzyme inducers: Substances that are inducers of CYP3A or P-gp decrease the plasma concentrations of Utromeg. No dose adjustment is needed for Utromeg when administered with therapeutic doses of rifampicin or other CYP3A or P-gp inducers.\r Effect of Utromeg on CYP2D6 substrates: In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of Utromeg towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the CYP2D6 activity recovers within 15 days after discontinuation of Utromeg. Multiple once daily dosing of Utromeg IR resulted in a 90% increase in Cmax and a 229% increase in AUC of a single dose of metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of Utromeg resulted in a 79% increase in Cmax and a 241% increase in AUC of a single dose of desipramine. Caution is advised if Utromeg is co-administered with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index and significantly metabolised by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, Type 1 C antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, propafenone) and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, desipramine). Caution is also advised if Utromeg is co-administered with CYP2D6 substrates that are individually dose titrated.\r Effect of Utromeg on transporters: Utromeg is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Utromeg increased Cmax and AUC by 29% and 27%, respectively, of the P-gp substrate digoxin in healthy volunteers. For patients who are initiating a combination of Utromeg and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should be prescribed initially. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect.\r Other interactions: No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when Utromeg was co-administered with therapeutic doses of solifenacin, tamsulosin, warfarin, metformin or a combined oral contraceptive medicinal product containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Dose-adjustment is not recommended.\rContraindications\rMirabegron is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients and severe uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects reported for patients treated with Utromeg 50 mg during the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies are tachycardia and urinary tract infections. The frequency of tachycardia was 1.2% in patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Tachycardia led to discontinuation in 0.1% patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. The frequency of urinary tract infections was 2.9% in patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Urinary tract infections led to discontinuation in none of the patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Serious adverse reactions included atrial fibrillation (0.2%).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited amount of data from the use of Mirabegron in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women is planning to be pregnant. Mirabegron is excreted in the milk of rodents and therefore is predicted to be present in human milk. No studies have been conducted to assess the impact of Mirabegron on milk production in humans, its presence in human breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. Mirabegron should not be administered during breast-feeding. There were no treatment-related effects of Mirabegron on fertility in animals. The effect of Mirabegron on human fertility has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: Utromeg has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis) and therefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient population. Data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2); based on a pharmacokinetic study a dose reduction to 25 mg is recommended in this population. Utromeg is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r Hepatic impairment: Utromeg has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and, therefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient population. Utromeg is not recommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r Hypertension: Utromeg can increase blood pressure. Blood pressure should be measured at baseline and periodically during treatment with Utromeg, especially in hypertensive patients. Data are limited in patients with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 100 mm Hg).\r Patients with congenital or acquired QT prolongation: Caution should be exercised when administering Utromeg in patients with congenital or acquired QT prolongation.\r Patients with bladder outlet obstruction and patients taking antimuscarinics medications for OAB: A controlled clinical safety study in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in patients treated with Utromeg; however, Utromeg should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. Utromeg should also be administered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB.\rOverdose Effects\rUtromeg has been administered to healthy volunteers at single doses up to 400 mg. At this dose, adverse events reported included palpitations and increased pulse rate exceeding 100 beats per minute (bpm). Multiple doses of Utromeg up to 300 mg daily for 10 days showed increases in pulse rate and systolic blood pressure when administered to healthy volunteers. Treatment for overdose should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdose, pulse rate, blood pressure, and ECG monitoring is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rBPH/ Urinary retention/ Urinary incontinence\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nUtromeg is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and urgency incontinence as may occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMirabegron is the first beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist.

Utromeg is not recommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r Hypertension: Utromeg can increase blood pressure. Blood pressure should be measured at baseline and periodically during treatment with Utromeg, especially in hypertensive patients. Data are limited in patients with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 100 mm Hg).\r Patients with congenital or acquired QT prolongation: Caution should be exercised when administering Utromeg in patients with congenital or acquired QT prolongation.\r Patients with bladder outlet obstruction and patients taking antimuscarinics medications for OAB: A controlled clinical safety study in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in patients treated with Utromeg; however, Utromeg should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. Utromeg should also be administered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB.\rOverdose Effects\rUtromeg has been administered to healthy volunteers at single doses up to 400 mg. At this dose, adverse events reported included palpitations and increased pulse rate exceeding 100 beats per minute (bpm). Multiple doses of Utromeg up to 300 mg daily for 10 days showed increases in pulse rate and systolic blood pressure when administered to healthy volunteers. Treatment for overdose should be symptomatic and supportive. In the event of overdose, pulse rate, blood pressure, and ECG monitoring is recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rBPH/ Urinary retention/ Urinary incontinence\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nUtromeg is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of urgency, increased micturition frequency and urgency incontinence as may occur in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMirabegron is the first beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist. Mirabegron exerts its effect via a dual mechanism, both directly acts on the bladder smooth muscle and also via the sensory nervous system, it increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and leads to relaxation of the detrusor smooth muscle during storage phase of urinary bladder fill-void cycle by activation of beta-3 adrenoceptor which increase bladder capacity.\r\nDosage\r\nAdults including elderly: The recommended starting dose is Mirabegron 25 mg tablet once daily with or without food. Based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to Mirabegron 50 mg tablet once daily.\r\n \nRenal or hepatic impairment:\r\nPatients with severe renal impairment (ClCr 15 to 29 mL/min or eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the daily dose of Mirabegron should not exceed 25 mg tablet once daily.\r\nMirabegron has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis) or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) and it is therefore not recommended for use in these patient populations.\r\nGender: No dose adjustment is necessary according to gender.\r\n \nPaediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Mirabegron in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nMirabegron tablet is to be taken once daily, with liquids, swallowed whole and is not to be chewed, divided, or crushed.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nEffect of enzyme inhibitors: Utromeg exposure (AUC) was increased 1.8-fold in the presence of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A/P-gp ketoconazole in healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment is needed when Utromeg is combined with inhibitors of CYP3A and/or P-gp. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir and clarithromycin, the recommended dose is 25 mg once daily with or without food. Utromeg is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or patients with moderate hepatic impairment concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r\n \nEffect of enzyme inducers: Substances that are inducers of CYP3A or P-gp decrease the plasma concentrations of Utromeg. No dose adjustment is needed for Utromeg when administered with therapeutic doses of rifampicin or other CYP3A or P-gp inducers.\r\n \nEffect of Utromeg on CYP2D6 substrates: In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of Utromeg towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the CYP2D6 activity recovers within 15 days after discontinuation of Utromeg. Multiple once daily dosing of Utromeg IR resulted in a 90% increase in Cmax and a 229% increase in AUC of a single dose of metoprolol. Multiple once daily dosing of Utromeg resulted in a 79% increase in Cmax and a 241% increase in AUC of a single dose of desipramine. Caution is advised if Utromeg is co-administered with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index and significantly metabolised by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, Type 1 C antiarrhythmics (e.g., flecainide, propafenone) and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, desipramine). Caution is also advised if Utromeg is co-administered with CYP2D6 substrates that are individually dose titrated.\r\n \nEffect of Utromeg on transporters: Utromeg is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Utromeg increased Cmax and AUC by 29% and 27%, respectively, of the P-gp substrate digoxin in healthy volunteers. For patients who are initiating a combination of Utromeg and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should be prescribed initially. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect.\r\n \nOther interactions: No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when Utromeg was co-administered with therapeutic doses of solifenacin, tamsulosin, warfarin, metformin or a combined oral contraceptive medicinal product containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Dose-adjustment is not recommended.\r\nContraindications\r\nMirabegron is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients and severe uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common side effects reported for patients treated with Utromeg 50 mg during the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies are tachycardia and urinary tract infections. The frequency of tachycardia was 1.2% in patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Tachycardia led to discontinuation in 0.1% patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. The frequency of urinary tract infections was 2.9% in patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Urinary tract infections led to discontinuation in none of the patients receiving Utromeg 50 mg. Serious adverse reactions included atrial fibrillation (0.2%).\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are limited amount of data from the use of Mirabegron in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Mirabegron is not recommended during pregnancy and in women is planning to be pregnant. Mirabegron is excreted in the milk of rodents and therefore is predicted to be present in human milk. No studies have been conducted to assess the impact of Mirabegron on milk production in humans, its presence in human breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. Mirabegron should not be administered during breast-feeding. There were no treatment-related effects of Mirabegron on fertility in animals. The effect of Mirabegron on human fertility has not been established.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nRenal impairment: Utromeg has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients requiring haemodialysis) and therefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient population. Data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2); based on a pharmacokinetic study a dose reduction to 25 mg is recommended in this population. Utromeg is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.\r\n \nHepatic impairment: Utromeg has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and, therefore, it is not recommended for use in this patient population.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Nexcital should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rVitamin B1, B6 & B12 tablets is indicated where a deficiency of the relevant vitamins exists. It is indicated for the treatment of following diseases: Polyneuropathy of any origin such alcoholic or toxiconeuropathies as-diabetic, Neuritis, Neuralgia, Cervical Syndrome, Shoulder-arm syndrome, Lumbago, Sciatica, Myalgia, Intercostal neuralgia, Herpes Zoster, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Supportive treatment in facial paresis.\rPovital - MedEx campaign banner\rNeucos-b - MedEx campaign banner\rComposition\rEach film-coated tablet contains: Vitamin B1 (Thiamine Mononitrate) 100 mg, Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride) 200 mg, Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) 200 microgram.\rEach 3 ml ampoule contains: Thiamine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1) 100 mg, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6) 100 mg, Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) 1000 mcg.\rNeurobest - MedEx campaign banner\rTpc - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rVitamin B1 converts carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids into energy, promotes healthy nerves, improves mood, strengthens the heart. Vitamin B6 forms RBCs, helps cells to make proteins, manufactures neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin and releases stored forms of energy, helps to prevent CVS diseases and stroke, helps to lift depression and eases insomnia. Vitamin B12 is essential for cell replication and important for RBC production, prevents anemia, helps to prevent depression, reduces nerve pain, numbness, tingling and lowers the risk of heart diseases.\r The vitamin ingredients are absorbed well in per oral reception. It is widely distributed to most tissues and appears in breast milk. Within the cell, thiamine is mostly present as diphosphate. Thiamine is not stored to any appreciable extent in the body and amounts in excess of the body’s requirements are excreted in the urine as unchanged thiamine or as metabolites. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the GIT following oral administration and are converted to the active forms of pyridoxal phosphate an pyridoxamine phosphate.

        "description": "Indications\rMyrica is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rMyrica CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Myrica is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Myrica should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Myrica should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Myrica, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Myrica when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Myrica may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Myrica is rapidly discontinued. Myrica should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Myrica may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Myrica and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Myrica extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Myrica, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Myrica is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Myrica should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Myrica should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Myrica, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Myrica when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Myrica may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Myrica is rapidly discontinued. Myrica should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Myrica may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Myrica and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Myrica extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Myrica, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\rPharmacology\rRivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues.\rDosage\rRivastigmine capsule-\rInitial dose: Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day.\rDose titration: The starting dose is Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to Rivastigmine 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.\rMaintenance dose: The effective dose is 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a day. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \rRe-initiation of therapy: If treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.\rRivastigmine transdermal patch: Apply patch on intact skin for a 24-hour period; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.\rInitial Dose: Initiate treatment with 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine transdermal patch.\rDose Titration: After a minimum of 4 weeks, if tolerated, increase dose to 9.5 mg/24 hours, which is the minimum effective dose. Following a minimum additional 4 weeks, may increase dosage to maximum dosage of 13.3 mg/24 hours.\rMild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5 mg/24 hours or 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rSevere Alzheimer’s Disease: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rFor treatment interruption longer than 3 days, retitrate dosage starting at 4.6 mg per 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, Demelon may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. In view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and Demelon.\rContraindications\rThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or other carbamate derivatives.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor Rivastigmine no clinical data are available. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. In animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects, resp diseases. Cholinergic stimulation may increase gastric acid secretion. May exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Pregnancy. Renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor body wt. Asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. May worsen extrapyramidal symptoms. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in moderate renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed\r Use in children: Demelon is not recommended for use in children.\rOverdose Effects\rMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms have occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to the known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may also occur. Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Dementia\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia.

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome. It is useful in relieving many of the symptoms of parkinsonism, particularly rigidity and bradykinesia. This tablet is frequently helpful in the management of tremor, dysphagia, sialorrhea and postural instability associated with Parkinson's disease and syndrome. Levodopa plus carbidopa before physiotherapy increases motor recovery after stroke.\rDescription\rLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of Levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more Levodopa becomes available to the brain.\rDosage & Administration\rIf 100/10 mg tablet is used: Dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. Titration upward may be required in some patients to achieve optimum dosage of carbidopa. The dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (two tablets q.d.s.) is reached.\r For patients starting with 250/25 mg tablet: The initial dose is one half taken once or twice daily. However, this may not provide the optimal amount of Carbidopa needed by many patients. If necessary, add one-half every day or every other day until optimal response is reached. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of Levodopa a day is one tablet of 250/25 mg three or four times a day.\r Maintenance dose: Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. When more levodopa is requried, 250/25 mg tablet should be substituted at a dosage of one tablet three or four times a day. If necessary, the dosage of 250/25 mg tablet may be increased by half to one tablet every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with a total daily dosage greater than 200 mg Carbidopa is limited.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when Carbidopa-Levodopa is added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive medicines. Therefore, when therapy with CarbidopaLevodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive medicine may be required. There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and Carbidopa-Levodopa. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of Carbidopa and/or Levodopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate. Dopamine-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones and risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of Levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of Levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicines with Carbidopa-Levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and Carbidopa-Levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to Carbidopa-Levodopa alone.\rContraindications\rCarbidopa-Levodopa tablet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Carbidopa and Levodopa, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Since Levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Carbidopa-Levodopa should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects that occur frequently in patients receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa are those due to the central neuropharmacologic activity of dopamine. These reactions usually can be diminished by dosage reduction. The most common adverse effects are dyskinesias including choreiform, dystonic, and other involuntary movements and nausea.\rBody as a whole: syncope, chest pain, anorexia.\rCardiovascular: palpitation, orthostatic effects including hypotensive episodes, hypertension, phlebitis.\rGastrointestinal: vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, diarrhoea, dark saliva.\rHaemotologic: leukopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\rHypersensitivity: angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\rNervous System: dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia, delusions, hallucinations and paranoid ideation, depression with or without development of suicidal tendencies, dementia, dream abnormalities, agitation, confusion, increased libido.\rRespiratory: dyspnea.\rSkin: alopecia, rash, dark sweat.\rUrogenital: dark urine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough the effects of CarbidopaLevodopa on human pregnancy are unknown both Levodopa and combinations of Carbidopa and Levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. Therefore, use of CarbidopaLevodopa in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the medicine be weighed against possible hazards should pregnancy occur. It is not known whether Carbidopa is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Carbidopa Levodopa may be given to patients already taking Levodopa alone; however, the Levodopa must be discontinued at least 12 hours before Carbidopa-Levodopa started. Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with Levodopa alone because Carbidopa permits more Levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Carbidopa-Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions.\r Care should be exercised to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have atriai, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with Carbidopa-Levodopa, provided the intraocular pressure is weli controlled and the patient monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Carbidopa-Levodopa in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 years is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\rPack Image of Co-dopa 250 mg Tablet\r\nIndications\r\nThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome. It is useful in relieving many of the symptoms of parkinsonism, particularly rigidity and bradykinesia. This tablet is frequently helpful in the management of tremor, dysphagia, sialorrhea and postural instability associated with Parkinson's disease and syndrome. Levodopa plus carbidopa before physiotherapy increases motor recovery after stroke.\r\nDescription\r\nLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain.

Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\rContraindications\rSodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Use of Sodium Valproate is restricted during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Valoate Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Valoate.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSodium Vaiproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Valoate CR is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided. Valoate CR should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rTherapeutic Class\rPrimary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30°C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nValoate CR Vaiproate oral is indicated for the treatment of all types of epilepsy, e.g.\r\nPartial seizures\r\nAbsence seizures (petit mal)\r\nGeneralized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal)\r\nMyoclonic seizures\r\nAtonic seizures\r\nMixed seizures that include absence attack\r\nProphylaxis of febrile convulsion\r\nProphylaxis of post-traumatic epilepsy.\r\nIt is also indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorder & prophylaxis of migraine.\r\nComposition\r\nSodium Valproate tablet: Each enteric-coated tablet contains Sodium Valproate BP 200 mg.\r\nSodium Valproate syrup: Each 5 ml syrup contains Sodium Valproate BP 200 mg.\r\nSodium Valproate controlled release 200 tablet: Each enteric-coated controlled release tablet contains Sodium Valproate 200 mg as Sodium Valproate BP 133.2 mg & Valproic acid BP 58 mg.\r\nSodium Valproate controlled release 300 tablet: Each enteric-coated controlled release tablet contains Sodium Valproate 300 mg as Sodium Valproate BP 199.8 mg & Valproic acid BP 87 mg.\r\nSodium Valproate controlled release 500 tablet: Each enteric-coated controlled release tablet contains Sodium Valproate 500 mg as Sodium Valproate BP 333 mg & Valproic acid BP 145 mg.\r\nSodium Valproate injection: Each 5 ml injectable solution contains Sodium Valproate BP eqv. to Valproic Acid 500 mg.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSodium Valproate, the active ingredient of this preparation is endowed with anti-epileptic activity against a variety of seizures. The mechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested that its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral: Sodium Valproate tablets may be given once or twice daily and syrup should be given in divided doses.\r\n \nEpilepsy:\r\nAdult: Initially, 600 mg daily is given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day intervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily (20-30 mg/kg daily).\r\nChildren (over 20 kg)- Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (usually in the range of 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily.\r\nChildren (up to 20 kg)- Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses.\r\nFebrile convulsion: 20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.\r\n \nBipolar disorder: Initially 600 mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day) in 2-3 divided doses.

It may be given by direct slow intravenous injection or by infusion using compatible diluents e.g. 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection, 5% Dextrose injection.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nValoate CR Vaiproate appears to act as a non specific inhibitor of drug metabolism. Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\r\nContraindications\r\nSodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Use of Sodium Valproate is restricted during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Valoate CR Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop.

        "description": "Indications\rTridyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\rDescription\rTridyl exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\rPharmacology\rTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r The total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\rContraindications\rTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\rSide Effects\rMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Tridyl than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Tridyl. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Tridyl, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Tridyl has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients to be treated with Tridyl should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Tridyl should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\revidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Tridyl. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\rOverdose Effects\rIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Tridyl over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Tridyl blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r  Signs and Symptoms: Over dosage with Tridyl produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r Treatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Tridyl is dialyzable.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place.

In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients to be treated with Tridyl should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Tridyl should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\r\nevidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Tridyl. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Tridyl over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Tridyl blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r\n \n \nSigns and Symptoms: Over dosage with Tridyl produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r\n \nTreatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Tridyl is dialyzable.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAntiparkinson drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place. Protect from light.",

        "description": "Indications\rTridyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\rDescription\rTridyl exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\rPharmacology\rTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r The total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\rContraindications\rTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\rSide Effects\rMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Tridyl than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Tridyl. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Tridyl, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18 to 64 years of age, who have all of the following:\rPersistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the patient wishes.\rMarked personal distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence of PE and poor control over ejaculation.\rPharmacology\rThe mechanism of action is thought to be related to inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin and subsequent potentiation of serotonin activity. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2C) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult (18 to 64 years of age): The recommended starting dose for all patients is 30 mg, taken as needed approximately 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is one dose every 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCNS active medicinal products: The use of Susten in combination with CNS active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated in patients with premature ejaculation. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of Susten and such medicinal products is required.\r PDE5 inhibitors: Tadalafil did not affect the pharmacokinetics of Susten. Sildenafil caused slight changes in Susten pharmacokinetics, which are not expected to be clinically significant. However, Susten should be prescribed with caution in patients who use PDE5 inhibitors due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r Tamsulosin: Concomitant administration of single or multiple doses of 30 mg or 60 mg Susten to patients receiving daily doses of Tamsulosin did not result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of Tamsulosin. However, Susten should be prescribed with caution in patients who use alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r Warfarin: There are no data evaluating the effect of chronic use of Warfarin with Susten; therefore, caution is advised when Susten is used in patients taking Warfarin chronically.\r Ethanol: Concomitant use of alcohol and Susten could increase the chance or severity of adverse reactions such as dizziness, drowsiness, slow reflexes, or altered judgment. Combining alcohol with Susten may increase these alcohol-related effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events such as syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Susten.\rContraindications\rPatients with known hypersensitivity to Dapoxetine Hydrochloride.\rPatients with significant pathological cardiac conditions such as heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (second or third degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease of significant valvular disease.\rConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), thioridazine. Similarly, MAOIs or thioridazine should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\rConcomitant treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or other medicinal/herbal products with serotonergic effects or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with these medicinal/herbal products.\rSide Effects\rDizziness, Headache, Somnolence, Tremor, Blurred vision, Tinnitus, Sinus congestion, Nausea, Diarrhea, Abdominal pain, Dry mouth, Fatigue, Insomnia, Hypertension.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDapoxetine is not indicated for use by women. It is not known either dapoxetine or its metabolites are excreted through human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatient with bleeding disorders, epilepsy, susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure. Not intended for use in women. Known CYP2D6 poor metabolisers.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no unexpected adverse events in a clinical pharmacology study of Susten with daily doses up to 240 mg. In general, symptoms of overdose with SSRIs include serotonin-mediated adverse reactions such as somnolence, gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, tremor, agitation and dizziness. In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Erectile Dysfunction\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C. Protect from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18 to 64 years of age, who have all of the following:\r\nPersistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the patient wishes.\r\nMarked personal distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence of PE and poor control over ejaculation.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe mechanism of action is thought to be related to inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin and subsequent potentiation of serotonin activity. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2C) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult (18 to 64 years of age): The recommended starting dose for all patients is 30 mg, taken as needed approximately 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is one dose every 24 hours.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCNS active medicinal products: The use of Susten in combination with CNS active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated in patients with premature ejaculation. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of Susten and such medicinal products is required.\r\n \nPDE5 inhibitors: Tadalafil did not affect the pharmacokinetics of Susten. Sildenafil caused slight changes in Susten pharmacokinetics, which are not expected to be clinically significant. However, Susten should be prescribed with caution in patients who use PDE5 inhibitors due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r\n \nTamsulosin: Concomitant administration of single or multiple doses of 30 mg or 60 mg Susten to patients receiving daily doses of Tamsulosin did not result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of Tamsulosin. However, Susten should be prescribed with caution in patients who use alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r\n \nWarfarin: There are no data evaluating the effect of chronic use of Warfarin with Susten; therefore, caution is advised when Susten is used in patients taking Warfarin chronically.\r\n \nEthanol: Concomitant use of alcohol and Susten could increase the chance or severity of adverse reactions such as dizziness, drowsiness, slow reflexes, or altered judgment. Combining alcohol with Susten may increase these alcohol-related effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events such as syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Susten.\r\nContraindications\r\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to Dapoxetine Hydrochloride.\r\nPatients with significant pathological cardiac conditions such as heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (second or third degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease of significant valvular disease.\r\nConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), thioridazine.

        "description": "Indications\rSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\rPharmacology\rRivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues.\rDosage\rRivastigmine capsule-\rInitial dose: Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day.\rDose titration: The starting dose is Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to Rivastigmine 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.\rMaintenance dose: The effective dose is 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a day. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \rRe-initiation of therapy: If treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.\rRivastigmine transdermal patch: Apply patch on intact skin for a 24-hour period; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.\rInitial Dose: Initiate treatment with 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine transdermal patch.\rDose Titration: After a minimum of 4 weeks, if tolerated, increase dose to 9.5 mg/24 hours, which is the minimum effective dose. Following a minimum additional 4 weeks, may increase dosage to maximum dosage of 13.3 mg/24 hours.\rMild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5 mg/24 hours or 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rSevere Alzheimer’s Disease: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rFor treatment interruption longer than 3 days, retitrate dosage starting at 4.6 mg per 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, Rivatig may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. In view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and Rivatig.\rContraindications\rThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or other carbamate derivatives.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor Rivastigmine no clinical data are available. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. In animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects, resp diseases. Cholinergic stimulation may increase gastric acid secretion. May exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Pregnancy. Renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor body wt. Asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. May worsen extrapyramidal symptoms. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in moderate renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed\r Use in children: Rivatig is not recommended for use in children.\rOverdose Effects\rMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms have occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to the known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may also occur. Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Dementia\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia.

        "description": "Indications\rProlert is indicated for the treatment of-\rdepressive illness\rbulimia nervosa\robsessive compulsive disorder.\rPharmacology\rFluoxetine has been shown to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic neuronal membrane which causes increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS. This result in numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Fluoxetine appears to have no effect on the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and does not exhibit anticholinergic, antihistaminic or α1 adrenergic blocking activity at usual therapeutic doses.\rDosage & Administration\rInitial treatment: Recent studies suggest that 20 mg/day of Fluoxetine may be sufficient to obtain satisfactory antidepressant response. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day administered in the morning is recommended as the initial dose.\r A dose increase may be considered after several weeks if no clinical improvement is observed. Dosage above 20 mg/day, should be administered on a bid schedule (i.e. morning and noon) and should not exceed a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. As with other antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect may be delayed until 4 weeks of treatment or longer. As with many other medications, a lower or less frequent dosage should be used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.\r A lower or less frequent dosage should also be considered for patients, such as elderly, with concurrent disease or on multiple medication. A recommended maximum dose for elderly patients is 60 mg per day.\r Maintenance treatment: It is generally agreed among expert psychopharmacologists that acute episode of depression requires several months or longer sustained pharmacologic therapy. Fluoxetine is also used in dosage of 60 mg daily for the management of bulimia nervosa.\r Use in children: The use of Fluoxetine in children is not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMAO inhibitors: Sometimes serious fatal reactions have been reported with concomitant use.\rAntidepressants: There have been greater than two fold increases of previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants.\rLithium: There have been reports of increased or decreased lithium levels when used concomitantly with Prolert.\rAntipsychotics: Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant Prolert.\rAnticonvulsants: Patients on stable dose of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.\rCNS active drugs: Caution is advised if concomitant administration of Prolert is required.\rContraindications\rFluoxetine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to it.\r Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs and changes of mental status that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) in patients receiving Fluoxetine in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and in patients who have recently discontinued Fluoxetine and are then started on MAOIs. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, Fluoxetine should not be used in combination with MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with MAOI. Since Fluoxetine and its major metabolites have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping Fluoxetine and before starting MAOI.\rSide Effects\rGastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, dry mouth, and diarrhoea.\r Neurological: Anxiety, nervousness, insomnia/ drowsiness and fatigue.\r Others: Excessive sweating, pruritus, skin rashes associated with liver, kidney and lung involvement. It has therefore been advised that Prolert therapy should be discontinued in any patient who develops a skin rash.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIn animal studies, no teratogenicity or harmful effect was found. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human responses, Fluoxetine should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. As Fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluoxetine is administered to nursing women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs Prolert undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, it should be used with caution and in reduced doses in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Because of its epileptogenic effect, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy or a history of such disorders. Prolert may alter glycaemic control and therefore caution is also warranted in diabetic subjects. Depressed patients with suicidal tendencies should be carefully supervised during treatment.

Keep all the medicines out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nProlert is indicated for the treatment of-\r\ndepressive illness\r\nbulimia nervosa\r\nobsessive compulsive disorder.\r\nPharmacology\r\nFluoxetine has been shown to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic neuronal membrane which causes increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS. This result in numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Fluoxetine appears to have no effect on the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and does not exhibit anticholinergic, antihistaminic or α1 adrenergic blocking activity at usual therapeutic doses.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nInitial treatment: Recent studies suggest that 20 mg/day of Fluoxetine may be sufficient to obtain satisfactory antidepressant response. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day administered in the morning is recommended as the initial dose.\r\n \nA dose increase may be considered after several weeks if no clinical improvement is observed. Dosage above 20 mg/day, should be administered on a bid schedule (i.e. morning and noon) and should not exceed a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. As with other antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect may be delayed until 4 weeks of treatment or longer. As with many other medications, a lower or less frequent dosage should be used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.\r\n \nA lower or less frequent dosage should also be considered for patients, such as elderly, with concurrent disease or on multiple medication. A recommended maximum dose for elderly patients is 60 mg per day.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment: It is generally agreed among expert psychopharmacologists that acute episode of depression requires several months or longer sustained pharmacologic therapy.

        "description": "Indications\rOxat  is indicated in:\rMajor Depressive Disorder\rObsessive Compulsive Disorder\rPanic Disorder\rSocial Anxiety Disorder\rGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\rPosttraumatic Stress Disorder.\rPharmacology\rThe efficacy of Paroxetine is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5 HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro radioligand binding studies indicate that paroxetine has little affinity for muscarinic, alpha1, alpha2, beta adrenergic, dopamine (D2), 5-HT1, 5 HT2 and histamine (H1)-receptors; antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic receptors has been associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. Because the relative potencies of paroxetine’s major metabolites are at most 1/50 of the parent compound, they are essentially inactive.\rDosage & Administration\rMajor Depressive Disorder:\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine (Paroxetine hydrochloride) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Some patients not responding to a 20 mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10 mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.\rMaintenance Therapy: Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of Paroxetine hydrochloride has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.\rObsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD):\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine (Paroxetine hydrochloride) should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of Paroxetine in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10 mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week.\rMaintenance Therapy: Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.\rPanic Disorder:\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The target dose of Paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.\rMaintenance Therapy: Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.\rSocial Anxiety Disorder (SAD):\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dosage is 20 mg/day.\rMaintenance Therapy: Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.\rGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended starting dosage and the established effective dosage is 20 mg/day.\rMaintenance Therapy: Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.\rPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):\rUsual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended starting dosage and the established effective dosage is 20 mg/day. Dose changes, if indicated, should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least 1 week.\rMaintenance Therapy: Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rFood/antacids: The absorption and pharmacokinetics of Oxat are not affected by food or antacids.\r Tryptophan: As with other 5-HT re uptake inhibitors, animal studies indicate that an interaction between Oxat and Tryptophan may occur, resulting in a ‘serotonin syndrome’ suggested by a combination of agitation, restlessness and gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea. \r Drug metabolizing enzyme inducers /inhibitors: The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of Oxat may be affected by drugs, which induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. When Oxat is to be coadministered with a known drug metabolizing inhibitor, consideration should be given to using doses at the lower end of the range. No initial dosage adjustment of Oxat is considered necessary when it is to be co-administered with known drug metabolizing enzyme inducers. Any subsequent dosage adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerabilityand efficacy).\r Alcohol: Although Oxat does not increase the impairment of mental and motor skill caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Oxat and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.\r Haloperidol/amylobarbitone/oxazepam: Experience in a limited number of healthy subjects has shown that Oxat did not increase the sedation and drowsiness associated with haloperidol, amylobarbitone or oxazepam when given in combination.\r MAOls: As with other 5-HT re uptake inhibitors, animal studies indicate that an interaction between Oxat and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may occur.\r Lithium: Since there is little clinical experience, and there have been reports of interaction of lithium with other 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors, the concurrent administration of Oxat and lithium should be undertaken with caution.\r Lithium levels should be monitored. Phenytoin / anticonvulsants: Co-administration of Oxat and phenytoin is associated with decreased plasma concentrations of Oxat and increased adverse experiences. Co-administration of Oxat with other anticonvulsants may also be associated with an increased incidence of adverse experiences.\r Warfarin: Preliminary data suggest that there may be a pharmacodynamic interaction between Oxat and warfarin, which may result in increased bleeding in the presence of unaltered prothrombin times. Oxat should therefore be administered with great caution to patients receiving oral anticoagulants.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use in patients taking either monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or thioridazine is contraindicated. This is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Paroxetine.\rSide Effects\rMajor depressive disorder: Asthenia, sweating, nausea, decreased appetite, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, nervousness, ejaculatory disturbance and other male genital disorders.\r Obsessive compulsive disorder: Nausea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, sweating, impotence and abnormal ejaculation.\r Panic disorder: Asthenia, sweating, decreased appetite, decreased libido , tremor, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\r Social anxiety disorder: Sweating, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, somnolence, tremor, decreased libido, yawn, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Asthenia, infection, constipation, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, decreased libido, somnolence, tremor, sweating and abnormal\rejaculation.\r Post-traumatic stress disorder: Asthenia, sweating nausea, dry mouth, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, somnolence, decreased libido, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThis drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Labor and Delivery: The effect of Paroxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\r Nursing Mothers: Like many other drugs, Paroxetine is secreted in human milk, and caution should be exercised when Paroxetine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCardiac conditions: Oxat does not produce clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ECG. Nevertheless, as with all psychoactive drugs, caution is advised when treating patients with cardiac conditions.\r Epilepsy: As with other antidepressants, Oxat should be used with caution in-patients with epilepsy.\r Seizures: Overall, the incidence of seizures is < 0.1% in patients treated with Oxat. Oxat should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures.\r ECT: There is little clinical experience of concurrent administration of Oxat with ECT.\r Ability to drive/use machines: Clinical experience has shown that therapy with Oxat is not associated with impairment of cognitive or psychomotor function. However, as with all psychoactive drugs, patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery.\r Discontinuation of Treatment with Oxat: Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications of Oxat employed a taper phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper phase regimen used in GAD and PTSD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped.\rUse in Special Populations\rDosage for Elderly or Debilitated, and Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children. Store at a cool and dry place. Protect from light and moisture.\nIndications\r\nOxat  is indicated in:\r\nMajor Depressive Disorder\r\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder\r\nPanic Disorder\r\nSocial Anxiety Disorder\r\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\r\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe efficacy of Paroxetine is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5 HT).

This is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Paroxetine.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMajor depressive disorder: Asthenia, sweating, nausea, decreased appetite, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, nervousness, ejaculatory disturbance and other male genital disorders.\r\n \nObsessive compulsive disorder: Nausea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, sweating, impotence and abnormal ejaculation.\r\n \nPanic disorder: Asthenia, sweating, decreased appetite, decreased libido , tremor, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\r\n \nSocial anxiety disorder: Sweating, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, somnolence, tremor, decreased libido, yawn, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\r\n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder: Asthenia, infection, constipation, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, decreased libido, somnolence, tremor, sweating and abnormal\r\nejaculation.\r\n \nPost-traumatic stress disorder: Asthenia, sweating nausea, dry mouth, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, somnolence, decreased libido, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\n \nLabor and Delivery: The effect of Paroxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Like many other drugs, Paroxetine is secreted in human milk, and caution should be exercised when Paroxetine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCardiac conditions: Oxat does not produce clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ECG. Nevertheless, as with all psychoactive drugs, caution is advised when treating patients with cardiac conditions.\r\n \nEpilepsy: As with other antidepressants, Oxat should be used with caution in-patients with epilepsy.\r\n \nSeizures: Overall, the incidence of seizures is < 0.1% in patients treated with Oxat. Oxat should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures.\r\n \nECT: There is little clinical experience of concurrent administration of Oxat with ECT.\r\n \nAbility to drive/use machines: Clinical experience has shown that therapy with Oxat is not associated with impairment of cognitive or psychomotor function. However, as with all psychoactive drugs, patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car and operate machinery.\r\n \nDiscontinuation of Treatment with Oxat: Recent clinical trials supporting the various approved indications of Oxat employed a taper phase regimen, rather than an abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The taper phase regimen used in GAD and PTSD clinical trials involved an incremental decrease in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals. When a daily dose of 20 mg/day was reached, patients were continued on this dose for 1 week before treatment was stopped.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nDosage for Elderly or Debilitated, and Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep out of the reach of children. Store at a cool and dry place. Protect from light and moisture.",

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Neurolin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neurolin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neurolin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neurolin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neurolin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neurolin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neurolin is rapidly discontinued. Neurolin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neurolin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neurolin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neurolin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Neurolin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Neurolin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neurolin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neurolin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neurolin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neurolin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neurolin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neurolin is rapidly discontinued. Neurolin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neurolin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neurolin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neurolin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Neurolin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

This area of the brain is involved in cognition and also has a role to play in learning and memory, in alertness and in consciousness. Piracetam does not produce either sedation or stimulation. Piracetam can act on the central nervous system in a variety of ways. It will modify neurotransmission within the brain, and can help to improve the metabolic environment essential for good neuronal function. It is also a haemorrheological agent and can improve microcirculation without producing vasodialation. When given as acute or long term treatment for patients' suffering from a functional CNS deficit, it will heighten alertness and increase cognitive function. This changes can seen as a significant increase in the a-and b-activity, with a reduction in d-activity on an EEG trace. Piracetam will protect and restore cognitive functional capacity for cerebral trauma, e.g. hypoxia or intoxication, and after electroshock therapy. Piracetam may be given alone or together with other drugs when treating myoclonia due to anoxia. It will reduce the duration of vestibular nystagamus. Piracetam will also improve regional oxygen and glucose uptake in the brain in patients suffering from dementia subsequent to multiple infarcts, or in those with cerebral ischaemia. Piracetam will inhibit the increased aggregation of activated platelets and, in conditions where there is abnormal rigidity of the RBC, it can restore deformability and the ability to pass through the microvasculature.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults:\rIn cerebrocortical insufficiency disorders: the usual dose is 800 mg 3 times a day.\rIn myoclonic seizures: a dose of 7.2 gm daily, increasing by 4.8 gm per day every 3 to 4 days up to a maximum of 20 gm daily, given in 2 or 3 divided doses.\rChildren: The daily dosage depends on the weight of the child, 50 mg/kg of body weight in 3 divided doses. Once the desired results have been obtained, reduce the initial dose by half.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIn a single case, confusion, irritability and sleep disorders were reported in concomitant use with thyroid extract. At present, no interaction has been observed with the following anti-epileptic drugs, clonazepam, carbamazepine, phenyton, phenobarbitone and sodium valporate, based on a small number of studies.\rContraindications\rPiracetam is contra-indicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min) and hepatic impairment. As the principal route of elimination for Piracetam is via the kidney, special care must be taken when treating patients known to suffer from renal insufficiency. Monitoring of renal function is recommended in such cases. The increase in half-life is directly related to the decrease in renal function and creatinine clearance. This is also true for the older patient in whom creatinine clearance is dependent on age. When the creatinine clearance is <60 ml/min, or serum creatinine is >1.25 mg/100 ml, the dosage prescribed should be calculated as follows:\rCrCl 60-40 ml/min: Dosage should be 1/2 of normal dose\rCrCl 40-20 ml/min: Dosage should be 1/4 of normal dose\rSide Effects\rThe side effects reported include nervousness, agitation, irritability, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The incidence of these during clinical trials was ( 5% ) and they were more often noted in the older patients taking > 2.4 gm daily. In the majority of cases, a dose reduction sufficed to make these symptoms disappear. Some patients may complain of fatigue or drowsiness, gastrointestinal problems, e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomachache have also been reported but their incidence during clinical trials was ≤ 2%. Other symptoms e.g. vertigo, headaches, trembling and sexual stimulation have occasionally been reported. Overdose: Neurolep appears to be devoid of toxicity even at very high doses and, therefore, the need for specific measures to be taken in case of an overdose is avoided. Drug Interactions: In a single case, confusion, irritability and sleep disorders were reported in concomitant use with thyroid extract. At present, no interaction has been observed with the following anti-epileptic drugs, clonazepam, carbamazepine, phenyton, phenobarbitone and sodium valporate, based on a small number of studies.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPiracetam should not be prescribed during pregnancy or when breast feeding, except under exceptional circumstances.

        "description": "Indications\rMirapro Tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamics: The mechanism of action of Mirtazapine as with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder is unknown. Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.\r Pharmacokinetics: After oral administration of Mirtazapine tablets, the active constituent mirtazapine is rapidly and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels after about 2 hours. Binding of mirtazapine to plasma proteins is approximately 85%. The mean half-life of elimination is 20-40 hours; (26 hours in males, 37 hours in females). The half-life of elimination is sufficient to justify once-a-day dosing. Mirtazapine displays linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized and eliminated via the urine and faeces four days. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and oxidation followed by conjugation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult dose: The recommended starting dose for Mirtazapine tablets is 15 mg/day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening or prior to sleep. The effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day and the patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a 30 mg to maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic response to a given dose.\r Use in children: Use in children are not recommended to Mirtazapine.\r Missed Dose: If anyone misses a dose of mirtazapine, take it as soon as remember unless it is close to when the next dose is due. If anyone missed a dose of medication and it is close to the time of next dose, skip the missed dose and should take next dose at the regularly scheduled time. One should not take double or more than prescribed dose.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMirapro has clinically significant drug-drug interactions with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) & other serotonergic drugs such as tryptophan, triptans, linezolid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. Mirapro may interrupt the metabolism or activity of Carbamazepine, Phenytoin or Cimetidine. Patient should avoid Alcohol & Diazepam while taking Mirapro.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity: Mirtazapine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Mirtazapine or to any of the excipients.\r Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: The concomitant use of Mirtazapine and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Mirtazapine should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects of Mirapro are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category-C. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Mirtazapine therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Patients who are to receive Mirapro should be warned about the risk of developing agranulocytosis. Mirapro may impair judgment, thinking, and particularly, motor skills, because of its prominent sedative effect. Clinically significant ALT (SGPT) elevations (≥3 times the upper limit of the normal range) may occur.\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep away from light and moisture. Store below 30º C. Keep all medicine out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nMirapro Tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).\r\nPharmacology\r\nPharmacodynamics: The mechanism of action of Mirtazapine as with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder is unknown. Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After oral administration of Mirtazapine tablets, the active constituent mirtazapine is rapidly and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels after about 2 hours. Binding of mirtazapine to plasma proteins is approximately 85%. The mean half-life of elimination is 20-40 hours; (26 hours in males, 37 hours in females). The half-life of elimination is sufficient to justify once-a-day dosing. Mirtazapine displays linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized and eliminated via the urine and faeces four days. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and oxidation followed by conjugation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult dose: The recommended starting dose for Mirtazapine tablets is 15 mg/day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening or prior to sleep. The effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day and the patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a 30 mg to maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic response to a given dose.\r\n \nUse in children: Use in children are not recommended to Mirtazapine.\r\n \nMissed Dose: If anyone misses a dose of mirtazapine, take it as soon as remember unless it is close to when the next dose is due. If anyone missed a dose of medication and it is close to the time of next dose, skip the missed dose and should take next dose at the regularly scheduled time. One should not take double or more than prescribed dose.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMirapro has clinically significant drug-drug interactions with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) & other serotonergic drugs such as tryptophan, triptans, linezolid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. Mirapro may interrupt the metabolism or activity of Carbamazepine, Phenytoin or Cimetidine. Patient should avoid Alcohol & Diazepam while taking Mirapro.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity: Mirtazapine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Mirtazapine or to any of the excipients.\r\n \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: The concomitant use of Mirtazapine and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Mirtazapine should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common side effects of Mirapro are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category-C. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Mirtazapine therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.

It is not effective in relieving migraine attacks once in progress.\rDescription\rMigranil is a tricyclic compound. It antagonizes serotonin receptor competitively. It possesses antihistamine, antibradykinin and weak anticholinergic properties. It also possesses appetite-stimulating properties.\rPharmacology\rPizotifen works by inhibiting the peripheral actions of serotonin and histamine in increasing the membrane permeability of cranial vessels and transudation of plasmakinin, while altering pain thresholds in migraines. By blocking 5-HT receptors, pizotifen attenuates the signalling of serotonin in causing cranial vasoconstriction, as well as serotonin-enhanced platelet function and aggregation. There is evidence that it also inhibits the peripheral actions of bradykinin. Pizotifen may inhibit serotonin reuptake by blood platelets, which affects the tonicity and decreases passive distension of extracranial arteries. The effects of pizotifen leading to appetite stimulation may be due to the drug acting at the metabolic level rather than a direct stimulation of the appetite centre.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Usually 1.5 mg daily. This may be taken as a single dose at night or in three divided doses. Dosage should be adjusted to the individual patient requirements up to a maximum of 4.5 mg daily.

        "description": "Indications\rIracet is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Iracet is indicated as adjunctive therapy-\rin the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.\rin the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\rin the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\rDescription\rThe precise mechanism(s) by which Iracet exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. Iracet showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemo convulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that Iracet inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that Iracet may selectively prevent hyper synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.\rDosage\rAdults and adolescents from 16 years of age: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg twice daily.\r Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment. Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r Pediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases, oral solution should be used.\r Monotherapy: The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy treatment have not been established.\rAdd-on therapy: Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. For children 6 years and above, oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not in multiples of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. The lowest effective dose should be used. The starting dose for a child or adolescent of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily. Dosing for children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\rAdd-on therapy: For infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months: The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rThe flm-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufcient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or without food. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAntiepileptic medicinal products: Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that Iracet did not influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of Iracet.\r Probenecid: Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of Iracet. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low.\r Methotrexate: Concomitant administration of Iracet and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and Iracet levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.\r Laxatives: There have been isolated reports of decreased Iracet efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral Iracet. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking Iracet.\r Food and alcohol: The extent of absorption of Iracet was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was slightly reduced. No data on the interaction of Iracet with alcohol are available.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% more than placebo) include:\rAdult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness\rPediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability\rPregnancy & Lactation\rLevetiracetam is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless clinically necessary. Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended. However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies. No clinical data are available, the potential risk for humans is unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: The administration of Iracet to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before dose selection.\r Acute kidney injury: The use of Iracet has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset ranging from a few days to several months.\r Blood cell counts: Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with Iracet administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders.\r Suicide: Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents (including Iracet). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\r Paediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Available data in children did not suggest an impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain unknown.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly (65 years and older): Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function.\r Renal impairment: The daily dose must be individualized according to renal function.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate renal insufficiency. Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min.\rOverdose Effects\rSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with Iracet overdoses. After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. There is no specifc antidote for Iracet.

Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r Pediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases, oral solution should be used.\r Monotherapy: The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy treatment have not been established.\rAdd-on therapy: Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. For children 6 years and above, oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not in multiples of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. The lowest effective dose should be used. The starting dose for a child or adolescent of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily. Dosing for children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\rAdd-on therapy: For infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months: The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rThe flm-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufcient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or without food. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAntiepileptic medicinal products: Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that Iracet did not influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of Iracet.\r Probenecid: Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of Iracet. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low.\r Methotrexate: Concomitant administration of Iracet and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and Iracet levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.\r Laxatives: There have been isolated reports of decreased Iracet efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral Iracet. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking Iracet.\r Food and alcohol: The extent of absorption of Iracet was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was slightly reduced. No data on the interaction of Iracet with alcohol are available.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% more than placebo) include:\rAdult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness\rPediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability\rPregnancy & Lactation\rLevetiracetam is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless clinically necessary. Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended. However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies. No clinical data are available, the potential risk for humans is unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: The administration of Iracet to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before dose selection.\r Acute kidney injury: The use of Iracet has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset ranging from a few days to several months.\r Blood cell counts: Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with Iracet administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders.\r Suicide: Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents (including Iracet). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\r Paediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Available data in children did not suggest an impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain unknown.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly (65 years and older): Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function.\r Renal impairment: The daily dose must be individualized according to renal function.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate renal insufficiency. Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min.\rOverdose Effects\rSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with Iracet overdoses. After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. There is no specifc antidote for Iracet. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for Iracet and 74% for the primary metabolite.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a cool temperature (not exceeding 25°C) and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nIracet is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Iracet is indicated as adjunctive therapy-\r\nin the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.\r\nin the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\r\nin the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\r\nDescription\r\nThe precise mechanism(s) by which Iracet exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. Iracet showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemo convulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that Iracet inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that Iracet may selectively prevent hyper synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.\r\nDosage\r\nAdults and adolescents from 16 years of age: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg twice daily.\r\n \nAdults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment. Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r\n \nPediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years.

It is a selective calcium channel antagonist. By reducing excessive transmembrane influx of calcium Flunarizine prevents cellular calcium overload. It does not interfere with normal cellular calcium homeostasis. Flunarizine also has some antihistaminic and sedative properties. It binds at an affinity of 99% to plasma protein.\rDosage & Administration\rMigraine Prophylaxis:\rStarting Dose: 10 mg at night in patients less than 65 years of age and 5 mg daily in patients older than 65 years. If, during this treatment depressive, extrapyramidal or other unacceptable symptoms occur, administration should be discontinued. If, after 2 months of this initial treatment, no significant improvement is observed, the patient should be considered a non-responder and administration should be discontinued.\rMaintenance Treatment: If a patient is responding satisfactorily and if a maintenance treatment is needed, the dose should be decreased to 5 days treatment at the same daily dose with two successive medicine free days every week. Even if the prophylactic maintenance treatment is successful and well tolerated, it should be interrupted after 6 months and it should be re-initiated only if the patient relapses.\rPeripheral Vascular disease: 10 mg twice daily, up to 30 mg per day if required.\r Vertigo & motion sickness: 10-20 mg daily for adults and 5 mg daily for children (> 40 kg).\r Epileptic seizure: 15-20 mg daily in adults and 5 to 10 mg daily for children as an add-on therapy\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rGalactorrhoea has been reported in few women on oral contraceptives within the first two months of Flurizin treatment. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as Carbamazepine and Phenytoin may interact with Flurizin by increasing its metabolism. So an increase in dosage of Flurizin may be required.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to Flunarizine. Flunarizine is contra-indicated in patients with a history of depressive illness, or with pre-existing symptoms of Parkinson's disease or other extrapyramidal disorders.\rSide Effects\rDrowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Flurizin: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk. Infrequently reported adverse reaction are: heartburn; nausea; gastralgia; insomnia; anxiety; galactorrhoea; dry mouth; muscle ache; skin rash.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafety in pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rFlurizin may lead to drowsiness which is aggravated by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Flurizin is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Flurizin. This treatment may give rise to extrapyramidal and depressive symptoms and reveal Parkinsonism, especially in predisposed patients such as the elderly.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Epitra in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epitra for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpitra does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epitra on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epitra are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epitra may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epitra may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epitra. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epitra in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epitra pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epitra might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epitra is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epitra.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Epitra (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epitra. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epitra infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Epitra 2 mg Tablet\rIs Epitra 2 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rEpitra 2 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Epitra 2 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Epitra 2 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpitra does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epitra on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epitra are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epitra may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epitra may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epitra. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epitra in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epitra pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epitra might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epitra is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epitra.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Epitra (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epitra. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epitra infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Epitra 1 mg Tablet\rIs Epitra 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rEpitra 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Epitra 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Epitra 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Epitra in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials.

        "description": "Indications\rDepram is indicated in-\rDepressive illness\rNocturnal enuresis in children.\rDescription\rDepram is an original tricyclic antidepressant, a member of the dibenzazepine group of compounds. The mechanism of action of Depram is not definitely known. However, it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. The clinical effect is hypothesized as being due to the potentiation of adrenergic synapses by blocking uptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. The mode of action of the drug in controlling childhood enuresis is thought to be apart from its antidepressant effect.\rPharmacology\rImipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signaling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.\rDosage & Administration\rDepression:\rInitially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients)\rUp to 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime\rElderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily\rChild not recommended for depression\rNocturnal enuresis:\rChild 7-8 years: 25 mg\r8-11 years: 25-50 mg\rOver 11 years: 50-75 mg at bedtime; max\rPeriod of treatment (including gradual withdrawal): 3 months-full physical examinations before the further course.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMethylphenidate may increase the effects of imipramine. This is usually avoided by reducing the dosage of imipramine. Depram may increase the depressant action of alcohol. Dangerously high blood pressure has resulted from the combination of imipramine, and members of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Because of this, imipramine should never be taken in combination with MAO inhibitors. Patients taking any MAO inhibitors, for example phenelzine sulfate or tranylcypromine sulfate, should stop the MAO inhibitor then wait at least 14 days before starting imipramine or any other tricyclic antidepressant. The same holds true when discontinuing imipramine and starting an MAO inhibitor. The anticholinergic (drying out) effects of imipramine are additive with other anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, biperiden, trihexyphenidyl, and antihistamines.\rContraindications\rImipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. The combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Depram usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category D. Limited data suggest that imipramine is likely to be excreted in human breast milk. Known risk of damage to fetus.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDepram should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Depram may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take Depram or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.\rOverdose Effects\rChildren have been reported to be more sensitive than adults to an acute overdosage of imipramine.

Bromocriptine mesilate is a dopamine receptor agonist, which activates post-synaptic dopamine receptors.The dopaminergic neurons in the tuberoinfundibular process modulate the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by secreting a prolactin inhibitory factor (thought to be dopamine); in the corpus striatum the dopaminergic neurons are involved in the control of motor function. Clinically, it significantly reduces plasma levels of prolactin in patients with physiologically elevated prolactin as well as in patients with hyperprolactinemia.\rDosage & Administration\rGeneral: It is recommended that Bromocriptine mesilate be taken with food. Patients should be evaluated frequently during dose escalation to determine the lowest dosage that produces a therapeutic response.\r Hyperprolactinemic lndications: The initial dosage is 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg tablet daily. An additional 2.5 mg tablet may be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated as tolerated every 2-7 days until an optimal therapeutic response is achieved.Based on limited data in children of age 11 to 15 the initial dose is 0.5 to 2.5 mg tablet daily. Dosing may need to be increased as tolerated until a therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5-10 mg daily in children with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas.\r Acromegaly: The initial recommended dosage is 0.5 to 2.5 mg on retiring (with food) for 3 days. An additional 0.5 to 2.5 mg should be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 3-7 days until patient obtains optimal therapeutic benefit. The maximal dosage should not exceed 100 mg/day.\r Parkinson's disease: The basic principle of bromocriptine mesilate therapy is to initiate treatment at a low dosage. The initial dose of Bromocriptine mesilate is 0.5 of a 2.5 mg tablet twice daily with meals. If necessary,the dosage may be increased every 14-28 days by 2.5 mg/day with meals.The safety of bromocriptine mesilate has not been demonstrated in dosages exceeding 100 mg/day.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBromolac may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of Bromolac: phenothi-azines, haloperidol, metodopramide, pimozide. Concomitant use of Bromolac with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended.\rContraindications\rUncontrolled hypertension and sensitivity to any ergot alkaloids. In patients being treated for hyperprolactinemia Bromocriptine mesilate should be withdrawn when pregnancy is diagnosed.\rPost partum period in women with a history of coronary artery disease & other severe cardiovascular conditions.\rSide Effects\rSide effects in decreasing order of frequency are: nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, lightheadedness, vomiting, abdominal cramps, nasal congestion constipation, diarrhea and drowsiness.

Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.\rCombination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased.\r Trigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day,either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg.

If any rash,skin peeling, itching, or other unexplained skin reaction is seen while taking this medicine the concerned doctor should be informed immediately.\r This medicine may rarely cause liver problems.For this reason, consultation with doctor is needed if unexplained itching, yellowing of the skin or eyes, unusually dark urine, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pains, and loss of appetite or flu-like symptoms.\r Anleptic decreases the blood levels of hormonal contraceptives containing estrogen and/or progesterone, which may make the contraceptive ineffective or result in breakthrough bleeding.\r Women taking this medicine who require contraception should be prescribed a contraceptive containing at least 50 micrograms of oestrogen,or use non-hormonal methods of contraception, such as condoms.\r Taking this medicine should not be stopped suddenly unless the doctor tells. Otherwise, as suddenly stopping treatment is likely to make the symptoms return.If this medicine is stopped, it should normally be done gradually, under the supervision of a specialist.\r Caution should be taken in-\rMixed seizures including absence seizures\rElderly people\rHistory of heart disease\rHistory of kidney disease\rHistory of liver disease\rHistory of psychotic illness\rRaised pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure), eg.glaucoma\rHistory of blood disorders that were caused by any other medication\rHistory of previous Anleptic therapy that was interrupted due to side effects or allergy\rTherapeutic Class\rPrimary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAnleptic is indicated for-\r\npartial and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures\r\nPrimary generalized tonic-clonic seizures\r\nTrigeminal neuralgia\r\nProphylaxis of bipolar disorder\r\nPharmacology\r\nCarbamazepine depresses activity in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus, reduces synaptic propagation of excitatory impulses or decreases summation of temporal stimulation leading to neural discharge by limiting influx of Na ions across cell membrane or other unknown mechanisms. It stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and potentiates its action in promoting reabsorption of water.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nEpilepsy:\r\nAdults and children over 12 years of age- Initial: Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and controlled release tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained.\r\nChildren 12-15 years of age- Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. Maintenance: usually 800-1200 mg daily.\r\nChildren 6-12 years of age- Initial: Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a b.i.d. or a t.i.d.or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance:usually 400-800 mg daily.\r\nChildren under 6 years of age- Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d.or t.i.d. as tablets, or q.i.d. as suspension. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.\r\nCombination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased.\r\n \nTrigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day,either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 50 mg (1/2 teaspoon) q.i.d. for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. A total dose of 1200 mg daily shouldn't be exceeded. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400-800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug. The tablets or syrup can be taken without regards to meal.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nGalactorrhoea has been reported in few women on oral contraceptives within the first two months of Anleptic treatment Hepatic enzyme inducers such as Anleptic and Phenytoin may interact with Anleptic by increasing its metabolism.

        "description": "Indications\rTofranil is indicated in-\rDepressive illness\rNocturnal enuresis in children.\rDescription\rTofranil is an original tricyclic antidepressant, a member of the dibenzazepine group of compounds. The mechanism of action of Tofranil is not definitely known. However, it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. The clinical effect is hypothesized as being due to the potentiation of adrenergic synapses by blocking uptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. The mode of action of the drug in controlling childhood enuresis is thought to be apart from its antidepressant effect.\rPharmacology\rImipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signaling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.\rDosage & Administration\rDepression:\rInitially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients)\rUp to 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime\rElderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily\rChild not recommended for depression\rNocturnal enuresis:\rChild 7-8 years: 25 mg\r8-11 years: 25-50 mg\rOver 11 years: 50-75 mg at bedtime; max\rPeriod of treatment (including gradual withdrawal): 3 months-full physical examinations before the further course.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMethylphenidate may increase the effects of imipramine. This is usually avoided by reducing the dosage of imipramine. Tofranil may increase the depressant action of alcohol. Dangerously high blood pressure has resulted from the combination of imipramine, and members of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Because of this, imipramine should never be taken in combination with MAO inhibitors. Patients taking any MAO inhibitors, for example phenelzine sulfate or tranylcypromine sulfate, should stop the MAO inhibitor then wait at least 14 days before starting imipramine or any other tricyclic antidepressant. The same holds true when discontinuing imipramine and starting an MAO inhibitor. The anticholinergic (drying out) effects of imipramine are additive with other anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, biperiden, trihexyphenidyl, and antihistamines.\rContraindications\rImipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. The combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Tofranil usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category D. Limited data suggest that imipramine is likely to be excreted in human breast milk. Known risk of damage to fetus.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTofranil should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Tofranil may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take Tofranil or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.\rOverdose Effects\rChildren have been reported to be more sensitive than adults to an acute overdosage of imipramine. An acute overdose in infants or young children must be considered serious and potentially fatal.\rTherapeutic Class\rTricyclic & related anti-depressant drugs, Tricyclic Anti-depressant\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nTofranil is indicated in-\r\nDepressive illness\r\nNocturnal enuresis in children.\r\nDescription\r\nTofranil is an original tricyclic antidepressant, a member of the dibenzazepine group of compounds. The mechanism of action of Tofranil is not definitely known. However, it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. The clinical effect is hypothesized as being due to the potentiation of adrenergic synapses by blocking uptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. The mode of action of the drug in controlling childhood enuresis is thought to be apart from its antidepressant effect.\r\nPharmacology\r\nImipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signaling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDepression:\r\nInitially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients)\r\nUp to 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime\r\nElderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily\r\nChild not recommended for depression\r\nNocturnal enuresis:\r\nChild 7-8 years: 25 mg\r\n8-11 years: 25-50 mg\r\nOver 11 years: 50-75 mg at bedtime; max\r\nPeriod of treatment (including gradual withdrawal): 3 months-full physical examinations before the further course.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMethylphenidate may increase the effects of imipramine. This is usually avoided by reducing the dosage of imipramine. Tofranil may increase the depressant action of alcohol. Dangerously high blood pressure has resulted from the combination of imipramine, and members of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Because of this, imipramine should never be taken in combination with MAO inhibitors. Patients taking any MAO inhibitors, for example phenelzine sulfate or tranylcypromine sulfate, should stop the MAO inhibitor then wait at least 14 days before starting imipramine or any other tricyclic antidepressant. The same holds true when discontinuing imipramine and starting an MAO inhibitor. The anticholinergic (drying out) effects of imipramine are additive with other anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, biperiden, trihexyphenidyl, and antihistamines.\r\nContraindications\r\nImipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. The combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Tofranil usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported.

        "description": "Indications\rErata is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Erata is indicated as adjunctive therapy-\rin the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.\rin the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\rin the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\rDescription\rThe precise mechanism(s) by which Erata exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. Erata showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemo convulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that Erata inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that Erata may selectively prevent hyper synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.\rDosage\rAdults and adolescents from 16 years of age: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg twice daily.\r Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment. Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r Pediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases, oral solution should be used.\r Monotherapy: The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy treatment have not been established.\rAdd-on therapy: Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. For children 6 years and above, oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not in multiples of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. The lowest effective dose should be used. The starting dose for a child or adolescent of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily. Dosing for children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\rAdd-on therapy: For infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months: The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rThe flm-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufcient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or without food. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAntiepileptic medicinal products: Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that Erata did not influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of Erata.\r Probenecid: Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of Erata. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low.\r Methotrexate: Concomitant administration of Erata and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and Erata levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.\r Laxatives: There have been isolated reports of decreased Erata efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral Erata. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking Erata.\r Food and alcohol: The extent of absorption of Erata was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was slightly reduced. No data on the interaction of Erata with alcohol are available.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% more than placebo) include:\rAdult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness\rPediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability\rPregnancy & Lactation\rLevetiracetam is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless clinically necessary. Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended. However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies. No clinical data are available, the potential risk for humans is unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: The administration of Erata to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before dose selection.\r Acute kidney injury: The use of Erata has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset ranging from a few days to several months.\r Blood cell counts: Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with Erata administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders.\r Suicide: Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents (including Erata). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\r Paediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Available data in children did not suggest an impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain unknown.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly (65 years and older): Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function.\r Renal impairment: The daily dose must be individualized according to renal function.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate renal insufficiency. Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min.\rOverdose Effects\rSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with Erata overdoses. After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. There is no specifc antidote for Erata. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for Erata and 74% for the primary metabolite.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a cool temperature (not exceeding 25°C) and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nErata is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended. However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies. No clinical data are available, the potential risk for humans is unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: The administration of Erata to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before dose selection.\r Acute kidney injury: The use of Erata has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset ranging from a few days to several months.\r Blood cell counts: Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with Erata administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders.\r Suicide: Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents (including Erata). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\r Paediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Available data in children did not suggest an impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain unknown.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly (65 years and older): Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function.\r Renal impairment: The daily dose must be individualized according to renal function.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate renal insufficiency. Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min.\rOverdose Effects\rSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with Erata overdoses. After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. There is no specifc antidote for Erata. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for Erata and 74% for the primary metabolite.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a cool temperature (not exceeding 25°C) and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nErata is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Erata is indicated as adjunctive therapy-\r\nin the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.\r\nin the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\r\nin the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\r\nDescription\r\nThe precise mechanism(s) by which Erata exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. Erata showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemo convulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that Erata inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that Erata may selectively prevent hyper synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.\r\nDosage\r\nAdults and adolescents from 16 years of age: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg twice daily.\r\n \nAdults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment. Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r\n \nPediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases, oral solution should be used.\r\n \nMonotherapy: The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy treatment have not been established.\r\nAdd-on therapy: Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. For children 6 years and above, oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not in multiples of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. The lowest effective dose should be used. The starting dose for a child or adolescent of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily. Dosing for children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\r\nAdd-on therapy: For infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months: The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nThe flm-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufcient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or without food. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAntiepileptic medicinal products: Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that Erata did not influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of Erata.\r\n \nProbenecid: Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of Erata. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low.\r\n \nMethotrexate: Concomitant administration of Erata and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and Erata levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.\r\n \nLaxatives: There have been isolated reports of decreased Erata efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral Erata. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking Erata.\r\n \nFood and alcohol: The extent of absorption of Erata was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was slightly reduced. No data on the interaction of Erata with alcohol are available.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% more than placebo) include:\r\nAdult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness\r\nPediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nLevetiracetam is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless clinically necessary.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Epnil in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epnil for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpnil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epnil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epnil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epnil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epnil may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epnil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epnil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epnil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epnil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epnil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epnil.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Epnil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epnil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epnil infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Epnil 1 mg Tablet\rIs Epnil 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rEpnil 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Epnil 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Epnil 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epnil.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Epnil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epnil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epnil infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Epnil in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epnil for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpnil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epnil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epnil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epnil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epnil may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epnil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epnil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epnil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epnil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epnil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure.

The physician who elects to use Epnil for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEpnil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epnil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epnil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epnil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epnil may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epnil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epnil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epnil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epnil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epnil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epnil.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Epnil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Epnil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Epnil infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Epnil 0.5 mg Tablet\rIs Epnil 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rEpnil 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Epnil 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Epnil 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rNorry is indicated in-\rEmotional disturbances, i.e. acute tension and anxiety states. Difficulties in interpersonal contact. Agitation, insomnia, anxious and agitated depressive reactions.\rFunctional disturbances in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, i.e. pseudoangina pectoris, pericardial anxiety, tachycardia, emotiogenic hypertension, dyspnea and hyperventilation.\rDisturbances in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. irritable bowel syndrome, epigastric pain, spasm, bloating diarrhea etc.\rDisturbances in the urinary tract, i.e. frequency, irritable bladder and dysmenorrhea.\rPsychosomatic disorder, i.e. psychogenic headache, asthma, gastric and duodenal ulcer.\rIt is also indicated in emotional reactions to chronic organic disease.\rPharmacology\rBromazepam is a powerful psychotropic agent. In lower dosage, it selectively reduces tension and anxiety. In higher dosage, it shows sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced.\rDosage\rStandard dosage: Average dosage for outpatient therapy is 1.5-3 mg up to three times daily. Treatment of outpatients should begin with low doses, gradually increasing to the optimum level.\r In severe cases, especially in hospital: 6-12 mg 2 or 3 times daily. The overall treatment generally should not be more than 8-12 weeks. In certain cases extension beyond the maximum treatment period may be necessary; if so, it should be taken with re-evaluation of the patient's status with special expertise.\r Elderly and debilitated patients: Elderly patients and those with impaired hepatic functions require lower doses.\r Children: Bromazepam is usually not indicated in children, but if the physician feels bromazepam treatment is appropriate, then the dose should be adjusted to their low bodyweight (about 0.1-0.3 mg/kg bodyweight)\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rBromazepam tablets are for oral administration\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIf Norry is combined with other centrally active drugs, its sedative effects may be enhanced. These drugs are antidepressants, hypnotics, narcotics, antipsychotics, sedatives, antiepileptic drugs, sedative antihistamines and anesthetics. Co-administration of cimetidine may prolong the eliminiation half-life of Norry. Concomitant intake of Norry with alcohol should be avoided, because the sedative effect of Norry may be intensified by alcohol.\rContraindications\rBromazepam is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bromazepam, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency or sleep apnea syndrome.\rSide Effects\rCommon side-effects include fatigue, drowsiness, muscle weakness, numbed muscle, reduced alertness, confusion, headache, ataxia etc. These phenomena occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with prolonged administration. Anterograde amnesia may occur using therapeutic doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety of bromazepam during pregnancy has not been established. As bromazepam is excreted in breast milk, use should be avoided during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine like agents may lead to the development of physical and psychological dependence upon these products. This dependence depends on the dose and duration of treatment; it is also greater in predisposed patients with a history of alcohol. Once physical dependence has developed, termination of the treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headache, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, confusion and irritability. Since the risk of withdrawal phenomena and rebound phenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of the treatment, it is recommended that the dosage be decreased gradually. Norry is not recommended for the primary treatment of sleeplessness caused by psychotic illness. Caution should be exercised while driving cars or using machineries.\rTherapeutic Class\rBenzodiazepine sedatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nNorry is indicated in-\r\nEmotional disturbances, i.e. acute tension and anxiety states. Difficulties in interpersonal contact.

        "description": "Indications\rGABA-P is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rGABA-P CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: GABA-P is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. GABA-P should be discontinued immediately in these cases. GABA-P should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including GABA-P, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with GABA-P when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. GABA-P may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if GABA-P is rapidly discontinued. GABA-P should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. GABA-P may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering GABA-P and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of GABA-P extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with GABA-P, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route.

If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal.

Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. GABA-P should be discontinued immediately in these cases. GABA-P should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including GABA-P, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with GABA-P when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. GABA-P may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if GABA-P is rapidly discontinued. GABA-P should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. GABA-P may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering GABA-P and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of GABA-P extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with GABA-P, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

It is a structural analog of gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA). All pharmacological actions following administration of Gabapentin are due to the activity of parent compound. Gabapentin binds with the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage gated L-type Calcium channel, and inhibits branched chain amino acid transferase & probably inhibits neurotransmitter release of excitatory amino acid.\rDosage\rNeuropathic Pain: The treatment may be initiated as a single 300 mg dose on Day-1, than 300 mg twice on Day-2 and 300 mg thrice on Day-3. The dose can be subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID).\r Epilepsy:\rPatients over 12 years of age: the effective dose of Gabapentin is 900 to 1800 mg/day given in three divided doses. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day.\rPaediatric patients age 3-12 year: the starting dose should range from 10-15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately three days.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rGabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAntacids may reduce the bioavailability of Gaba by up to 20 %. Cimetidine may alter its reanal excretion. Gaba does not interact with other anti-epileptic drug or with oral contraceptive preparations.\rContraindications\rGabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug.\rSide Effects\rFatigue, Dizziness, ataxia, weight gain, peripheral edema, dry mouth and somnolence may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. it should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefits justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

It is a structural analog of gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA). All pharmacological actions following administration of Gabapentin are due to the activity of parent compound. Gabapentin binds with the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage gated L-type Calcium channel, and inhibits branched chain amino acid transferase & probably inhibits neurotransmitter release of excitatory amino acid.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic Pain: The treatment may be initiated as a single 300 mg dose on Day-1, than 300 mg twice on Day-2 and 300 mg thrice on Day-3. The dose can be subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID).\r\n \nEpilepsy:\r\nPatients over 12 years of age: the effective dose of Gabapentin is 900 to 1800 mg/day given in three divided doses. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day.\r\nPaediatric patients age 3-12 year: the starting dose should range from 10-15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately three days.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nGabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAntacids may reduce the bioavailability of Gaba by up to 20 %. Cimetidine may alter its reanal excretion. Gaba does not interact with other anti-epileptic drug or with oral contraceptive preparations.\r\nContraindications\r\nGabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug.\r\nSide Effects\r\nFatigue, Dizziness, ataxia, weight gain, peripheral edema, dry mouth and somnolence may occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category C. it should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefits justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

        "description": "Indications\rEpicet is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Epicet is indicated as adjunctive therapy-\rin the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, children and infants from 1 month of age with epilepsy.\rin the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.\rin the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy.\rDescription\rThe precise mechanism(s) by which Epicet exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. Epicet showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemo convulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that Epicet inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that Epicet may selectively prevent hyper synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.\rDosage\rAdults and adolescents from 16 years of age: The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 500 mg twice daily after two weeks. The dose can be further increased by 250 mg twice daily every two weeks depending upon the clinical response. The maximum dose is 1500 mg twice daily.\r Adults (≥18 years) and adolescents (12 to 17 years) weighing 50 kg or more: The initial therapeutic dose is 500 mg twice daily. This dose can be started on the first day of treatment. Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice daily. Dose changes can be made in 500 mg twice daily increases or decrease every two to four weeks.\r Pediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in this population. In addition, the available dose strengths of the tablets are not appropriate for initial treatment in children weighing less than 25 kg, for patients unable to swallow tablets or for the administration of doses below 250 mg. In all of the above cases, oral solution should be used.\r Monotherapy: The safety and efficacy of levetiracetam in children and adolescents below 16 years as monotherapy treatment have not been established.\rAdd-on therapy: Oral solution is the preferred formulation for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. For children 6 years and above, oral solution should be used for doses under 250 mg, for doses not in multiples of 250 mg when dosing recommendation is not achievable by taking multiple tablets and for patients unable to swallow tablets. The lowest effective dose should be used. The starting dose for a child or adolescent of 25 kg should be 250 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 750 mg twice daily. Dosing for children 50 kg or greater is the same as in adults.\rAdd-on therapy: For infants aged from 1 month to less than 6 months: The oral solution is the formulation to use in infants.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rThe flm-coated tablets must be taken orally, swallowed with a sufcient quantity of liquid and may be taken with or without food. The daily dose is administered in two equally divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAntiepileptic medicinal products: Pre-marketing data from clinical studies conducted in adults indicate that Epicet did not influence the serum concentrations of existing antiepileptic medicinal products (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, gabapentin and primidone) and that these antiepileptic medicinal products did not influence the pharmacokinetics of Epicet.\r Probenecid: Probenecid (500 mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite but not of Epicet. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low.\r Methotrexate: Concomitant administration of Epicet and methotrexate has been reported to decrease methotrexate clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood methotrexate concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood methotrexate and Epicet levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.\r Laxatives: There have been isolated reports of decreased Epicet efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral Epicet. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking Epicet.\r Food and alcohol: The extent of absorption of Epicet was not altered by food, but the rate of absorption was slightly reduced. No data on the interaction of Epicet with alcohol are available.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% more than placebo) include:\rAdult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness\rPediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability\rPregnancy & Lactation\rLevetiracetam is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception unless clinically necessary. Levetiracetam is excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended. However, if levetiracetam treatment is needed during breastfeeding, the benefit/risk of the treatment should be weighed considering the importance of breastfeeding. No impact on fertility was detected in animal studies. No clinical data are available, the potential risk for humans is unknown.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rRenal impairment: The administration of Epicet to patients with renal impairment may require dose adjustment. In patients with severely impaired hepatic function, assessment of renal function is recommended before dose selection.\r Acute kidney injury: The use of Epicet has been very rarely associated with acute kidney injury with a time to onset ranging from a few days to several months.\r Blood cell counts: Rare cases of decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia) have been described in association with Epicet administration, generally at the beginning of the treatment. Complete blood cell counts are advised in patients experiencing important weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections or coagulation disorders.\r Suicide: Suicide, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents (including Epicet). A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has shown a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known. Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\r Paediatric population: The tablet formulation is not adapted for use in infants and children under the age of 6 years. Available data in children did not suggest an impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children remain unknown.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly (65 years and older): Adjustment of the dose is recommended in elderly patients with compromised renal function.\r Renal impairment: The daily dose must be individualized according to renal function.\r Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the creatinine clearance may underestimate renal insufficiency. Therefore a 50 % reduction of the daily maintenance dose is recommended when the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min.\rOverdose Effects\rSomnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with Epicet overdoses. After an acute overdose, the stomach may be emptied by gastric lavage or by induction of emesis. There is no specifc antidote for Epicet. Treatment of an overdose will be symptomatic and may include haemodialysis. The dialyser extraction efficiency is 60 % for Epicet and 74% for the primary metabolite.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at a cool temperature (not exceeding 25°C) and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nEpicet is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Denixil in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Denixil for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDenixil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Denixil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Denixil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Denixil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Denixil may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Denixil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Denixil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Denixil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Denixil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Denixil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Denixil.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Denixil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Denixil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Denixil in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Denixil for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDenixil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Denixil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Denixil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Denixil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Denixil may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Denixil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Denixil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Denixil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Denixil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Denixil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Denixil.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Denixil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Denixil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Denixil infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDenixil does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Denixil on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Denixil are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Denixil may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Denixil may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Denixil. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Denixil in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Denixil pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Denixil might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Denixil is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Denixil.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Denixil (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Denixil. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Denixil infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Denixil 0.5 mg Tablet\r\nIs Denixil 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nDenixil 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Denixil 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Denixil 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Pregaba is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Pregaba should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Pregaba should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Pregaba, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Pregaba when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Pregaba may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Pregaba is rapidly discontinued. Pregaba should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Pregaba may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Pregaba and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Pregaba extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Pregaba, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Pregaba is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Pregaba should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Pregaba should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Pregaba, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Pregaba when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Pregaba may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Pregaba is rapidly discontinued. Pregaba should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Pregaba may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Pregaba and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Pregaba extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Pregaba, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Pase in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pase for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Pase in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pase for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Pase in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pase for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nPase does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Pase on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Pase are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Pase may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Pase may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Pase. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Pase in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Pase pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Pase might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Pase is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Pase.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Pase (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Pase. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Pase infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Pase 2 mg Tablet\r\nIs Pase 2 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nPase 2 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Pase 2 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Pase 2 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Pase may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Pase may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Pase. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Pase in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Pase pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Pase might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Pase is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Pase.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Pase (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Pase. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Pase infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Pase 1 mg Tablet\r\nIs Pase 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nPase 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Pase 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Pase 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rAmilin is indicated in-\rDepressive Illness: particularly where sedation is required.\rNocturnal Enuresis in children.\rProphylaxis of Migraine.\rTension Headache.\rChronic Pain.\rDescription\rAmilin is a tricyclic antidepressant. It has marked anticholinergic and sedative properties. It prevents the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin at the nerve ending. Amilin is rapidly absorbed from the Gl tract. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 2-12 hours. Amilin is excreted in the urine, mainly in the form of its metabolites.\rPharmacology\rThe mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown.\rDosage & Administration\rDepression: Initially 75 mg (Elderly and Adolescents 30-75 mg) daily in divided doses or as a single dose at bedtime increased gradually as necessary to 150-200 mg; Child under 16 years not recommended for depression.\r Nocturnal Enuresis: Child 7-10 years: 10-20 mg, 11-16 years: 25-50 mg at night; max. period of treatment (including gradual withdrawal) 3 months-full physical examination before the further course.\r Prophylaxis of Migraine: 100 mg daily.\r Tension Headache: 10-25 mg three times daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTCA enhances the sedative effect of alcohol and opioid analgesics. When TCA is used with Moxifloxacin or Terfenadine, it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Disulfirum and Cimetidine inhibit the metabolism of Amilin. When TCA is used with diuretics, it enhances the risk of postural hypotension.\rContraindications\rAmitriptyline is contraindicated in myocardial infarction, arrythmias, particularly heart block of any degree, mania and severe liver disease. Initially, sedation may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.\rSide Effects\rAnticholinergic: Excessive perspiration, dry mouth, blurred vision, hyperpyrexia, urinary retention and urinary tract dilatation.\rCardiovascular reactions: Hypotension, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, myocardial infarction, etc.\rCNS and Neuromuscular: Confusional states, disturbed concentration, disorientation, delusions, etc.\rAllergic: Skin rash, urticaria, photosensitization, etc.\rHaematological: Bone-marrow depression.\rGastrointestinal: Nausea, epigastric distress, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, unpleasant taste, weight loss, diarrhoea, constipation, etc.\rEndocrine: Testicular swelling, gynaecomastia, breast enlargement, galactorrhoea, etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Amitriptyline should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Amitriptyline is excreted into breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Amitriptyline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIt should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy, glaucoma, urinary retention, cardiac disease, diabetes, pregnancy, hepatic impairment, thyroid disease, increased intra-ocular pressure and psychoses (may aggravate mania).\rTherapeutic Class\rTricyclic Anti-depressant\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, below 30°C.

Depending on the response, dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg/day. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day. Occasional patients with panic disorder may need as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response and in these cases periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage adjustment is required.\r Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect with the lowest possible dose.

Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.\rCombination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased.\r Trigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day,either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Pandura in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pandura for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin.

Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPandura does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Pandura on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Pandura are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Pandura may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Pandura may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Pandura. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Pandura in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Pandura pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Pandura might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Pandura is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Pandura.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Pandura (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Pandura. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Pandura infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Pandura 1 mg Tablet\rIs Pandura 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rPandura 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Pandura 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Pandura 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Pandura in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pandura for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities.

During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Pandura in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Pandura for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nPandura does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Pandura on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Pandura are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Pandura may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Pandura may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Pandura. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Pandura in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Pandura pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Pandura might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Pandura is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Pandura.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins.

Therefore, nursing should not be undertaken by mothers who must use Alprazolam.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBecause Zolium may produce psychological and physical dependence, the increment of dose or abrupt discontinuation of Zolium therapy should not be done without the physician's advice. The duration of therapy must be determined by the physicians. Zolium should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic or renal disease, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, or sleep apnea.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nThe safety and effectiveness of Zolium in individuals below 18 years of age have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nManifestations of Zolium overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes, and coma. In such cases of overdosage general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nBenzodiazepine sedatives\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

The\rmechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested\rthat its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\r  INDICATIONS\r Sodium Valproate oral is indicated for the treatment of all types of epilepsy, e.g. Partial seizures, Absence seizures (petit\rmal), Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal), Myoclonic seizures, Atonic seizures, Mixed seizures that include absence\rattack, Prophylaxis of febrile convulsion, Prophylaxis of post-traumatic epilepsy. It is also indicated in the treatment of\rbipolar disorder & prophylaxis of migraine.\r Injection: Indicated in epileptic patients for whom oral therapy is temporarily not possible.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Oral: Sodium Valproate tablets may be given once or twice daily and syrup should be given in divided doses.\rEpilepsy: Adult-Initially 600 mg daily given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day\rintervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily\r(20-30 mg/kg daily). Children (over 20 kg)- Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (usually in the range\rof 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily. Children (up to 20 kg)- Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses.\rFebrile convulsion: 20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.\rBipolar disorder: Initially 600 mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day) in 2-3 divided doses. Maintenance dosage is 1000-2000 mg daily.\rProphylaxis of migraine: 400-600 mg daily, although some may require 1000-1500 mg daily.\r Injection: Adults-May be given a slow intravenous injection over 3-5 minutes, usually 400-800 mg depending on body weight (up to\r10 mg/kg) followed by continuous or repeated infusion up to a maximum of 2500 mg/day. For children- Initial: 20-30 mg/kg/day,\rMaximum: 40 mg/kg/day. It may be given by direct slow intravenous injection or by infusion using compatible diluents e.g. 0.9%\rSodium Chloride injection, 5% Dextrose injection.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r The most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric\rcoated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a\rdecrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Sodium Valproate has several\reffects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs\rasymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children\rbelow 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone\rto suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Sodium\rValproate\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Liver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue\rpotential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment,\rpregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sodium Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone\rmetabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided.\rSodium Valproate should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Sodium Valproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural\rtube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Valproate should be offered to\restimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast milk. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium\rValproate probably causes no risk to the child.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r Sodium Valproate appears to act as a non specific inhibitor of drug metabolism. Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are\rPhenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\r  STORAGE\r Do not store above 30°C.

However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Valex Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Valex.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSodium Vaiproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Valex is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided. Valex should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nPrimary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30°C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.",

The mechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested that its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\rDosage & Administration\rOral: Sodium Valproate tablets may be given once or twice daily and syrup should be given in divided doses.\r Epilepsy:\rAdult: Initially, 600 mg daily is given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day intervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily (20-30 mg/kg daily).\rChildren (over 20 kg)- Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (usually in the range of 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily.\rChildren (up to 20 kg)- Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses.\rFebrile convulsion: 20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.\r Bipolar disorder: Initially 600 mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day) in 2-3 divided doses.

Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\rContraindications\rSodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Use of Sodium Valproate is restricted during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Valex CR Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Valex CR.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSodium Vaiproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Valex CR is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided.

        "description": "Indications\rTrihexy is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\rDescription\rTrihexy exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\rPharmacology\rTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r The total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\rContraindications\rTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\rSide Effects\rMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Trihexy than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Trihexy. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Trihexy, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Trihexy has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients to be treated with Trihexy should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Trihexy should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\revidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Trihexy. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\rOverdose Effects\rIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Trihexy over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Trihexy blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r  Signs and Symptoms: Over dosage with Trihexy produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r Treatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Trihexy is dialyzable.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place.

Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients to be treated with Trihexy should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Trihexy should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\revidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Trihexy. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\rOverdose Effects\rIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Trihexy over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Trihexy blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r  Signs and Symptoms: Over dosage with Trihexy produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r Treatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Trihexy is dialyzable.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place. Protect from light.\nIndications\r\nTrihexy is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\r\nDescription\r\nTrihexy exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\r\nPharmacology\r\nTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r\n \nIdiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r\n \nDrug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r\n \nConcomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r\n \nThe total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r\n \nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\r\nContraindications\r\nTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Trihexy than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Trihexy. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Trihexy, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Trihexy has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases).

        "description": "Indications\rEpilepsy: Topirva is indicated as monotherapy in adults and children aged 6 years and above with newly diagnosed epilepsy who have generalised tonic-clonic seizures or partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures. Topirva is indicated as adjunctive therapy for adults and children over 2 years of age who are inadequately controlled on conventional first line antiepileptic drugs for partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures; seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures.\r Migraine: Topirva is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine headache. Prophylactic treatment of migraine may be considered in situations such as: adults experiencing three or more migraine attacks per month; frequent migraine attacks that significantly interfere with the patient's daily routine. Continuing therapy should be reviewed every six months.\rPharmacology\rA seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.\r The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.\r Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.\rDosage & Administration\rEpilepsy: Monotherapy:\rAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1 week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 25 or 59 mg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy is 100 mg/day and the maximum recommended daily dose is 400 mg.\rChildren aged 6-16 years: Treatment of children aged 6 years and above should begin at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose range for topiramate monotherapy in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy aged 6 years and above is 3 to 6 mg/kg/day. Higher doses have been tolerated and rarely doses up to 16 mg/kg/day have been given.\rEpilepsy: Adjunctive therapy:\rAdults and children over 16 years: The minimal effective dose as adjunctive therapy is 200 mg per day. The usual total daily dose is 200 mg to 400 mg in two divided doses. Some patients may require doses up to 800 mg per day, which is the maximum recommended dose.\rChildren aged 2-16 years: The recommended total daily dose of Topiramate as adjunctive therapy is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. Daily doses up to 30 mg/kg/day have been studied and were generally well tolerated.\rMigraine:\rAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1-week. The dosage should then be increased in increments of 25 mg/day administered at 1-week intervals. The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for the prophylaxis of migraine headache is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses. Some patients may experience a benefit at a total daily dose of 50 mg/day.\rChildren: Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis has not been studied in children under 16 years.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThe addition of Topirva to other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic add, phenobarbitai, primidone) has no clinically significant effect on their steady-state plasma concentrations, except in some patients where the addition of Topirva to phenytoin may result in an increase of plasma concentrations of phenytoin.\r CNS Depressants: Topirva should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.\r Oral Contraceptives: In an interaction study with a combined oral contraceptive, Topirva increased plasma clearance of the oestrogenic component significantly. Consequently, and bearing in mind the potential risk of teratogenicity, patients should receive a preparation containing not less than 50 μg of oestrogen or use some alternative non-hormonal method of contraception. Patients taking oral contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns.\r Lithium: In patients with bipolar disorder, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with Topirva at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure (26% for AUC) following Topirva doses of up to 600 mg/day. Lithium levels should be monitored when co-administered with Topirva.\r Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ): The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of Topirva. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after Topirva or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and Topirva were administered in combination.\r Metformin: Topirva did not affect metformin tmax. The clinical significance of the effect of Topirva on metformin pharmacokinetics is unclear. Oral plasma clearance of Topirva appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on Topirva pharmacokinetics is unclear. When Topirva is added or withdrawn in patients on metformin therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Pioglitazone: When Topirva is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to Topirva therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Glibenclamide: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of Topirva were unaffected by concomitant administration of glibenclamide. When Topirva is added to glibenclamide therapy or glibenclamide is added to Topirva therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Others: Topirva, when used concomitantly with other agents predisposing to nephrolithiasis, may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis. While using Topirva, agents like these should be avoided since they may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of renal stone formation. The interaction with benzodiazepines has not been studied. \r Valproic Acid: Concomitant administration of Topirva and valproic acid has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. An association of hyperammonemia with Topirva monotherapy or concomitant treatment with other anti epileptics has not been established.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rNausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, taste disturbance, weight loss, anorexia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, speech disorder, drowsiness, insomnia, impaired memory & concentration, anxiety, depression, visual disturbance, lesscommonly: sucidal ideation, rarely: reduced sweetening mainly children, metabolic acidosis and alopecia, very rarely: Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and serious skin reaction.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTopiramate should not be used during pregnancy unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Topiramate should not be used during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including Topirva, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency. Topirva can produce central nervous system-related adverse events and may be more sedative than other antiepileptic drugs. Drowsiness is a likelihood. In addition, there have been reports of visual disturbances/blurred vision. Patients should be warned of these and advised that if affected, they should not drive, operate machinery and/or take part in activities where such reactions could put themselves or others at risk.\rOverdose Effects\rTopirva overdose can result in severe metabolic acidosis. In acute Topirva overdose, if the ingestion is recent, the stomach should be emptied immediately by lavage or by induction of emesis. Activated charcoal has been shown to adsorb Topirva in vitro. Treatment should be appropriately supportive. Haemodialysis has been shown to be an effective means of removing Topirva from the body. The patient should be well hydrated.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

The interaction with benzodiazepines has not been studied. \r\n \nValproic Acid: Concomitant administration of Topirva and valproic acid has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. An association of hyperammonemia with Topirva monotherapy or concomitant treatment with other anti epileptics has not been established.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nNausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, taste disturbance, weight loss, anorexia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, speech disorder, drowsiness, insomnia, impaired memory & concentration, anxiety, depression, visual disturbance, lesscommonly: sucidal ideation, rarely: reduced sweetening mainly children, metabolic acidosis and alopecia, very rarely: Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and serious skin reaction.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nTopiramate should not be used during pregnancy unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Topiramate should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIn patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including Topirva, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency. Topirva can produce central nervous system-related adverse events and may be more sedative than other antiepileptic drugs. Drowsiness is a likelihood. In addition, there have been reports of visual disturbances/blurred vision. Patients should be warned of these and advised that if affected, they should not drive, operate machinery and/or take part in activities where such reactions could put themselves or others at risk.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nTopirva overdose can result in severe metabolic acidosis. In acute Topirva overdose, if the ingestion is recent, the stomach should be emptied immediately by lavage or by induction of emesis. Activated charcoal has been shown to adsorb Topirva in vitro. Treatment should be appropriately supportive. Haemodialysis has been shown to be an effective means of removing Topirva from the body. The patient should be well hydrated.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.ts",

Quetiapine\ris an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1 ,\rand adrenergic a1 and a2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rThe mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is\rmediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may\rexplain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rElimination of Quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours. Steady-state\rconcentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of\rdrugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Quetiapine Fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak\rplasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of\rQuetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively. It\ris 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Following a single oral dose less than 1% of the administered dose\ris excreted as unchanged drug. Approximately 73% and 20% of the doses were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.\rQuetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver.\r  INDICATIONS\r Bipolar Mania: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, as either\rmonotherapy or adjunct therapy to\r lithium or divalproex.\r Schizophrenia: Quetiapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Quetiapine\ris an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1 ,\rand adrenergic a1 and a2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rThe mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is\rmediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may\rexplain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rElimination of Quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism with a mean terminal half-life of about 6 hours. Steady-state\rconcentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of\rdrugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Quetiapine Fumarate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak\rplasma concentrations in 1.5 hours. The tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution. The bioavailability of\rQuetiapine is marginally affected by administration with food, with Cmax and AUC values increased by 25% and 15%, respectively.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB, or\rbenzodiazepine receptors. It binds with high affinity to the alpha 2-delta site (an auxilliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium\rchannels) in central nervous system tissues. Oral bioavailability of Pregabalin is 90%. Pregabalin is eliminated largely by renal\rexcretion, and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours. Pregabalin can be taken with or without food.\r  INDICATIONS\r Neuralgia: (a) pain from diabetic neuropathy, (b) post herpetic neuralgia\r Partial seizure / epilepsy: Pregabalin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Neuropathic pain\rInitially 150 mg daily in 2 divided doses, increased if necessary after 3-7 days to 300 mg daily in 2 divided\rdoses, increased further if necessary after 7 days to maximum 600 mg daily in 2 divided doses.\rPost herpetic neuralgia\rThe recommended dose of pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two\rtimes a day and may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.\rFibromyalgia\rThe recommended dose of pregabalin for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg daily in 2 divided doses.\rEpilepsy\rInitially 150 mg daily in 2 divided doses, increased if necessary after 7 days to 300 mg in 2 divided doses,\rincreased further if necessary after 7 days to maximum 600 mg daily in 2 divided doses.\rGeneralised anxiety disorder\rInitially 150 mg daily in 2 divided doses, increased if necessary after 7 days to 300 mg in 2 divided doses,\rincreased further if necessary after 7 days to maximum 600 mg daily in 2 divided doses.\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rThe recommended dose is 150 to 600 mg /day. Initially 75 mg b.i.d; may be increased to 150 mg b.i.d (300\rmg /day) within 1 week . Maximum 300 mg b.i.d (600 mg/day)\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Pregabalin is well tolerated but a few side effects like dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision may occur.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of Pregabalin may produce some symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache and diarrhoea. So\rPregabalin should be tapered gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinued abruptly. Pregabalin treatment may\rassociate with creatine kinase elevations. It should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated\rcreatine kinase levels occur.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy: Pregabalin is a pregnancy category-C drug. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies\rthe potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Pregabalin may be secreted through the breast milk like other drugs, so it should be used in nursing women only if the\rbenefits clearly overweigh the risks.\r Pediatric Use\rThe safety and efficacy of Pregabalin in pediatric patients have not been established.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r The extent of Pregabalin absorption is unaffected by gabapentin co-administration.

The\rclinical effect is hypothesized as being due to potentiation of adrenergic synapses by blocking uptake of norepinephrine at nerve\rendings. The mode of action of the drug in controlling childhood enuresis is thought to be apart from its antidepressant effect.\r    INDICATIONS\r Depressive illness, nocturnal enuresis in children.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Depression, initially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients); up\rto 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime; elderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily; child\rnot recommended for depression.\rNocturnal enuresis, child 7-8 years 25 mg, 8-11 years 25-50 mg, over 11 years 50-75 mg at bedtime; max. period of treatment\r(including gradual withdrawal) 3 months-full physical examination before further course.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r The most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability,\rdizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be\rmanaged by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and\rdecreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion,\rdisorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking\rimipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness),\rseizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping\rare all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.\r   PRECAUTIONS\r Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign\rprostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when\rimipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other\rsedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with\rcardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the\rsame pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart\rconduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic\rdosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is\rincreased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of\rpre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.\r   USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy category D. Limited data suggest that imipramine is likely to be excreted in human breast milk. Known risk of damage to\rfetus.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r Methylphenidate may increase the effects of imipramine. This is usually avoided by reducing the dosage of imipramine. Imipramine\rmay increase the depressant action of alcohol. Dangerously high blood pressure has resulted from the combination of imipramine,\rand members of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Because of this, imipramine should never be taken in combination with MAO\rinhibitors. Patients taking any MAO inhibitors, for example phenelzine sulfate or tranylcypromine sulfate, should stop the MAO\rinhibitor then wait at least 14 days before starting imipramine or any other tricyclic antidepressant. The same holds true when\rdiscontinuing imipramine and starting an MAO inhibitor. The anticholinergic (drying out) effects of imipramine are additive with\rother anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, biperiden, trihexyphenidyl, and antihistamines.\r  OVER DOSE\r Children have been reported to be more sensitive than adults to an acute overdosage of imipramine. An acute overdose in infants or\ryoung children must be considered serious and potentially fatal.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Pramin Tablet: Each box contains 5 blister strips of 10 Tablets.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nPramin tablet: Each tablet contains Imipramine hydrochloride BP 25 mg.\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nImipramine hydrochloride is a original tricyclic antidepressant, a member of the dibenzazepine group of compounds.

        "description": "Indications\rMitaprex Tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rPharmacology\rPharmacodynamics: The mechanism of action of Mirtazapine as with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder is unknown. Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.\r Pharmacokinetics: After oral administration of Mirtazapine tablets, the active constituent mirtazapine is rapidly and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels after about 2 hours. Binding of mirtazapine to plasma proteins is approximately 85%. The mean half-life of elimination is 20-40 hours; (26 hours in males, 37 hours in females). The half-life of elimination is sufficient to justify once-a-day dosing. Mirtazapine displays linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized and eliminated via the urine and faeces four days. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and oxidation followed by conjugation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult dose: The recommended starting dose for Mirtazapine tablets is 15 mg/day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening or prior to sleep. The effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day and the patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a 30 mg to maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic response to a given dose.\r Use in children: Use in children are not recommended to Mirtazapine.\r Missed Dose: If anyone misses a dose of mirtazapine, take it as soon as remember unless it is close to when the next dose is due. If anyone missed a dose of medication and it is close to the time of next dose, skip the missed dose and should take next dose at the regularly scheduled time. One should not take double or more than prescribed dose.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMitaprex has clinically significant drug-drug interactions with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) & other serotonergic drugs such as tryptophan, triptans, linezolid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. Mitaprex may interrupt the metabolism or activity of Carbamazepine, Phenytoin or Cimetidine. Patient should avoid Alcohol & Diazepam while taking Mitaprex.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity: Mirtazapine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Mirtazapine or to any of the excipients.\r Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: The concomitant use of Mirtazapine and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Mirtazapine should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects of Mitaprex are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category-C. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Mirtazapine therapy.

Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that Mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5- HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, a property that may explain its prominent sedative effects. Mirtazapine is a moderate peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist, a property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.\r\n \nPharmacokinetics: After oral administration of Mirtazapine tablets, the active constituent mirtazapine is rapidly and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels after about 2 hours. Binding of mirtazapine to plasma proteins is approximately 85%. The mean half-life of elimination is 20-40 hours; (26 hours in males, 37 hours in females). The half-life of elimination is sufficient to justify once-a-day dosing. Mirtazapine displays linear pharmacokinetics within the recommended dose range. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized and eliminated via the urine and faeces four days. Major pathways of biotransformation are demethylation and oxidation followed by conjugation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdult dose: The recommended starting dose for Mirtazapine tablets is 15 mg/day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening or prior to sleep. The effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day and the patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a 30 mg to maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic response to a given dose.\r\n \nUse in children: Use in children are not recommended to Mirtazapine.\r\n \nMissed Dose: If anyone misses a dose of mirtazapine, take it as soon as remember unless it is close to when the next dose is due. If anyone missed a dose of medication and it is close to the time of next dose, skip the missed dose and should take next dose at the regularly scheduled time. One should not take double or more than prescribed dose.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMitaprex has clinically significant drug-drug interactions with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) & other serotonergic drugs such as tryptophan, triptans, linezolid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, lithium, tramadol, or St. John's wort. Mitaprex may interrupt the metabolism or activity of Carbamazepine, Phenytoin or Cimetidine. Patient should avoid Alcohol & Diazepam while taking Mitaprex.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity: Mirtazapine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Mirtazapine or to any of the excipients.\r\n \nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: The concomitant use of Mirtazapine and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. Mirtazapine should not be used within 14 days of initiating or discontinuing therapy with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common side effects of Mitaprex are dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain etc.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category-C.

Lamogin controls epileptic seizures by inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizes neuronal membranes and consequently inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g., glutamate and aspartate) release.\rPharmacology\rThe exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.\r Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.\r Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors. An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.\rDosage & Administration\rEpilepsy-\rTable-1:

Lamogin controls epileptic seizures by inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizes neuronal membranes and consequently inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g., glutamate and aspartate) release.\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.\r\n \nLamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.\r\n \nLamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors. An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.\r\nDosage &

It also exerts an anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effect.\rPharmacology\rThe actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep, anesthesia, and amnesia. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.\rDosage & Administration\rOral dosage:\rFor adults: 7.5-15 mg daily.\rIn elderly and debilitated patients: The recommended dose is 7.5 mg.\rIn premedication: 15 mg of Midazolam should be given 30-60 minutes before the procedure.\rIntravenous administration:\rEndoscopic or Cardiovascular Procedures: In healthy adults, the initial dose is approximately 2.5 mg.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Esipram should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "PRESENTATION\r Esipram 5: Each tablet contains Escitalopram INN 5 mg (as Escitalopram Oxalate).\r Esipram 10: Each tablet contains Escitalopram INN 10 mg (as Escitalopram Oxalate).\r  DESCRIPTION\r The antidepressant action of escitalopram is presumably linked to the potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous\rsystem (CNS) resulting from its inhibitory effect on the reuptake of 5-HT from the synaptic cleft. Escitalopram is the\rS-enantiomer of the racemate citalopram and is the enantiomer to which the therapeutic activity is attributed. Pharmacological\rstudies have shown that the R-enantiomer is not inert but counteracts the serotonin-enhancing properties of the S-enantiomer in\rcitalopram. Escitalopram has high affinity for the primary binding site and an allosteric modulating effect on the serotonin\rtransporter.\r  INDICATIONS\r • Depressive illness\r • Generalized anxiety disorder\r • Obsessive-compulsive disorder\r • Social anxiety disorder\r    DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Depressive illness, Generalized anxiety disorder & Obsessive-compulsive disorder : Adult over 18 years, 10 mg once daily increased\rif necessary to max. 20 mg daily; elderly initially half adult dose, lower maintenance dose may be sufficient; child not\rrecommended: Panic disorder : Adult over 18 years, initially 5 mg once daily increased to 10 mg daily after 7 days; max. 20 mg\rdaily; elderly initially half adult dose, lower maintenance dose may be sufficient; Social anxiety disorder : Adult over 18 years,\rinitially 10 mg once daily adjusted after 2-4 weeks; usual dose 5-20 mg daily.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Escitalopram is well tolerated by most people. The most commonly reported side-effects of Escitalopram are nausea, insomnia,\rproblems with ejaculation, drowsiness, increased sweating and fatigue. Most of the side-effects experienced by patients taking\rEscitalopram are mild and go away with continued treatment and usually do not cause patients to stop taking Escitalopram.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Escitalopram should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions\rdevelop), cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma, a history of mania or bleeding disorders\r(especially gastro-intestinal bleeding) and if used with other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding, hepatic impairment, renal\rimpairment, pregnancy and breast-feeding. It should also be used with caution in those receiving concurrent electroconvulsive\rtherapy. Escitalopram may also impair performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving).\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Category C. No relevant epidemiological data or well controlled studies in pregnant women are available for escitalopram.\rEscitalopram has had limited use in pregnancy without a reported increase in birth defects. Neonates should be observed if\rmaternal use of Escitalopram continues into the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Abrupt\rdiscontinuation should be avoided during pregnancy. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and only\rafter careful consideration of the risk/benefit. It is expected that escitalopram, like citalopram, will be excreted into human\rbreast milk.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r Escitalopram should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Disopan in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Disopan for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDisopan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Disopan on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Disopan are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Disopan may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Disopan may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Disopan. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Disopan in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Disopan pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Disopan might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Disopan is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Disopan.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Disopan (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Disopan. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Disopan infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Disopan 0.5 mg Tablet\rIs Disopan 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rDisopan 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Disopan 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Disopan 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Disopan in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Disopan for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDisopan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Disopan on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Disopan are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients.

Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal.\rDosage & Administration\rSuggested doses of Phenobarbital for specific indications are as follows:\r Pediatric Oral Dosage:\rPreoperative: 1 mg to 3 mg/kg.\rAnticonvulsant: 1 mg to 6 mg/kg per day\rAdult Oral Dosage:\rDaytime sedative: 30 mg to 120 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses.\rBedtime hypnotic: 100 mg to 320 mg.\rAnticonvulsant: 50 mg to 100 mg 2 to 3 times daily.\rPediatric Injection Dosage:\r15 to 20 mg/kg IV over 10 to 15 min.\rPreoperative Sedation:1 to 3 mg/kg IM/IV;\rAnticonvulsant: 4 to 6 mg/kg IM/IV per day, for 10 days.

Phenobarbital can cause fetal damage when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be in risk of the potential hazard to the fetus. Caution should be taken when Phenobarbital is administered to a nursing woman since small amounts of Phenobarbital are excreted in the milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continuing use.

In patients with hepatic damage, Barbit Elixir should be administered with caution and initially reduced doses.\rOverdose Effects\rThe toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. In general, an oral dose of 1 gram of most barbiturates produces serious poisoning in an adult. Death commonly occurs after 2 to 10 grams of ingested barbiturate. Acute overdosage with barbiturates is manifested by CNS and respiratory depression Treatment of overdosage is mainly supportive and immediate hospitalization is necessary.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Barbiturates\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nBarbit Elixir is indicated for the following conditions:\r\nSedatives\r\nHypnotics for the short-term treatment of insomnia\r\nPre-anesthetics\r\nLong-term anticonvulsants for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic and cortical local seizures. And, in the emergency control of certain acute convulsive episodes, (those associated with status epilepticus, eclampsia meningitis, tetanus, and toxic reactions to Strychnine or local anesthetics).\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nDescription\r\nBarbit Elixir is a barbiturate, nonselective, central nervous system depressant which is primarily used as a sedative hypnotic and also as an anticonvulsant in subhypnotic doses.\r\nPharmacology\r\nPhenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal). Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSuggested doses of Phenobarbital for specific indications are as follows:\r\n \nPediatric Oral Dosage:\r\nPreoperative: 1 mg to 3 mg/kg.\r\nAnticonvulsant: 1 mg to 6 mg/kg per day\r\nAdult Oral Dosage:\r\nDaytime sedative: 30 mg to 120 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses.\r\nBedtime hypnotic: 100 mg to 320 mg.\r\nAnticonvulsant: 50 mg to 100 mg 2 to 3 times daily.\r\nPediatric Injection Dosage:\r\n15 to 20 mg/kg IV over 10 to 15 min.\r\nPreoperative Sedation:1 to 3 mg/kg IM/IV;\r\nAnticonvulsant: 4 to 6 mg/kg IM/IV per day, for 10 days. Alternatively, use 10 to 15 mg/kg IM/IV per day to reach therapeutic level more quickly. Maxium IV rate 60 mg/min.\r\nAdult Injection Dosage:\r\nInsomnia: 100 to 320 mg IM/IV;\r\nConvulsions: 100 to 320 mg IV. Repeat if needed (maximum, 600 mg per day);\r\nStatus Epilepticus: 10 to 20 mg/kg IV. Repeat if needed.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nThe concomitant use of Alcohol or other CNS depressants may produce additive CNS depressant effects.\r\nContraindications\r\nPhenobarbital is contraindicated in patients with known Phenobarbital sensitivity or a history of latent porphyria.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most common adverse reaction is somnolence.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Esita should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Esita should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture. Keep the medicine out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nEsita is indicated in the-\r\nTreatment of major depressive episodes.\r\nTreatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.\r\nTreatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\r\nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder.\r\nTreatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\r\nPharmacology\r\nEscitalopram is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\r\nDosage\r\nSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r\n \nMajor depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r\n \nPanic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r\n \nSocial anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r\n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r\n \nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Clonatril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Clonatril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rClonatril does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Clonatril on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Clonatril are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Clonatril may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Clonatril may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Clonatril. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Clonatril in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Clonatril pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Clonatril might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Clonatril is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Clonatril.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Clonatril (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Clonatril. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Clonatril infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet\rIs Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rClonatril 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Clonatril. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Clonatril in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Clonatril pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Clonatril might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Clonatril is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Clonatril.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Clonatril (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Clonatril. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Clonatril infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet\r\nIs Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nClonatril 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Clonatril 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Clonatril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Clonatril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rClonatril does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Clonatril on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Clonatril are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Clonatril may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Clonatril may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion.

The treatment or prevention of nausea and vomiting of various causes. The management of psychotic disorders, such as acute or chronic catatonic, hebephrenic and paranoid schizophrenia; psychosis due to organic brain damage, toxic psychosis, and the manic phase of manic-depressive illness.\rPharmacology\rTrifluoperazine is one of the phenothiazine class of compounds and as such has many pharmacodynamic effects which relate to its therapeutic actions and side effects. The most notable action of phenothiazines is antagonism at dopamine receptors in the CNS. It is hypothesised that this action in the limbic system and associated areas of cerebral cortex is the basis of the antipsychotic action of phenothiazines, whilst in the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone it appears to be responsible for the antiemetic effect of these agents.\rDosage & Administration\rSchizophrenia and other psychoses:\rAdults and child over 12 years: Recommended starting dose is 2-5 mg b.i.d, increased by 5 mg daily after 1 week then at interval of 3 days, according to response. \rChildren (6-12 years): Dosage should be adjusted to the weight of the child and severity of the symptoms.

Concomitant administration of propranolol with Telazine results in increased plasma levels of both drugs. Antihypertensive effects of guanethidine and related compounds may be counteracted when phenothiazines are used concurrently. Potentiation may occur if antipsychotic drugs are combined with CNS depressants such as alcohol. hypnotics and anticonvulsant.\rContraindications\rDo not use Trifluoperazine in comatose patients, or in those with existing blood dyscrasias or known liver damage, or in those hypersensitive to the active ingredient or related compounds.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects are transient restlessness, dystonias or may resemble parkinsonism. Other CNS Reactions are drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, seizures. Without these Peripheral oedema, blood dyscrasias, jaundice may occasionally occur.

Therefore, it is not recommended that the drug be given to pregnant patients except when, in the judgement of the physician, it is essential. The potential benefits should clearly outweigh possible hazards. There are reported instances of prolonged jaundices, extrapyramidal signs, hyperreflexia or hypoflexia in newborn infants whose mother received phenothiazines.\r Lactation: Adequate human data are not available in case of lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken when treating elderly patients, and initial dosage should be reduced.

In low doses (up to 3 mg/day)\rflupentixol has an anxiolytic, antidepressive and mood stabilizing effect and certain, activating properties. It acts mainly through a blockage of central monoamine receptors, especially in the dopaminergic system.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: Standard initial dosage is 1 mg as a single morning dose. After one week the dose may be increased to 2 mg if there is inadequate clinical response. Daily dosage of more than 2 mg should be in divided doses up to a maximum 3 mg. In view of the activating properties of flupentixol, it is advisable to give the last dose of the day no later than evening. Patients often respond to flupentixol within two or three days. If no effect has been observed within one week at maximum dosage the drug should be withdrawn.\r In psychosis: Standard initial dosage is 3 to 9 mg twice daily adjusted according to the response; maximum 18 mg daily.\r Elderly: Standard initial dosage is 0.5 mg as a single morning dose. After one week, if response is inadequate, dosage may be increased to 1 mg once a day. Caution should be exercised in further increasing the dosage but occasional patients may require up to a maximum of 2 mg a day which should be given in divided doses (1 mg at breakfast time and 1 mg at about evening).\r Children: It is not recommended in children.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rWhen given with other drugs that product postural hypotension dosage adjustments may be necessary. Phenothiazines have been reported to reduce the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and other adrenergic neuron blockers. Phenothiazines may potentiate the adverse effects of other antimuscarinics. Concomitant administration of metoclopramide may increase the risk of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal effects and antiarrhythmics which prolong the QT interval may increase the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmias.\rContraindications\rIt may be contra-indicated in excitable and overactive patients, comatose states, Pre-existing CNS depression, bone marrow suppression and phaeochromocytoma. Severe alcohol, barbiturate and opiate intoxications. Flupentixol is not recommended for the treatment of severe depression requiring ECT and/or hospitalization.

        "description": "Indications\rPG is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rPG CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: PG is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. PG should be discontinued immediately in these cases. PG should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including PG, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with PG when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. PG may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if PG is rapidly discontinued. PG should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. PG may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering PG and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of PG extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with PG, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: PG is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. PG should be discontinued immediately in these cases. PG should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including PG, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with PG when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. PG may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if PG is rapidly discontinued. PG should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. PG may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering PG and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of PG extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with PG, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: PG is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. PG should be discontinued immediately in these cases. PG should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including PG, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with PG when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. PG may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if PG is rapidly discontinued. PG should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. PG may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering PG and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of PG extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with PG, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It is a selective calcium channel antagonist. By reducing excessive transmembrane influx of calcium Flunarizine prevents cellular calcium overload. It does not interfere with normal cellular calcium homeostasis. Flunarizine also has some antihistaminic and sedative properties. It binds at an affinity of 99% to plasma protein.\rDosage & Administration\rMigraine Prophylaxis:\rStarting Dose: 10 mg at night in patients less than 65 years of age and 5 mg daily in patients older than 65 years. If, during this treatment depressive, extrapyramidal or other unacceptable symptoms occur, administration should be discontinued. If, after 2 months of this initial treatment, no significant improvement is observed, the patient should be considered a non-responder and administration should be discontinued.\rMaintenance Treatment: If a patient is responding satisfactorily and if a maintenance treatment is needed, the dose should be decreased to 5 days treatment at the same daily dose with two successive medicine free days every week. Even if the prophylactic maintenance treatment is successful and well tolerated, it should be interrupted after 6 months and it should be re-initiated only if the patient relapses.\rPeripheral Vascular disease: 10 mg twice daily, up to 30 mg per day if required.\r Vertigo & motion sickness: 10-20 mg daily for adults and 5 mg daily for children (> 40 kg).\r Epileptic seizure: 15-20 mg daily in adults and 5 to 10 mg daily for children as an add-on therapy\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rGalactorrhoea has been reported in few women on oral contraceptives within the first two months of Norium treatment.

Flunarizine is contra-indicated in patients with a history of depressive illness, or with pre-existing symptoms of Parkinson's disease or other extrapyramidal disorders.\rSide Effects\rDrowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Norium: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk. Infrequently reported adverse reaction are: heartburn; nausea; gastralgia; insomnia; anxiety; galactorrhoea; dry mouth; muscle ache; skin rash.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafety in pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNorium may lead to drowsiness which is aggravated by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Norium is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Norium.

        "description": "Indications\rMilam is indicated in-\rShort-term treatment of insomnia.\rSedation in premedication before surgical or diagnostic procedures.\rDescription\rMilam is a sleep-inducing agent characterized by a rapid onset and short duration of action. It also exerts an anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effect.\rPharmacology\rThe actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep, anesthesia, and amnesia. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.\rDosage & Administration\rOral dosage:\rFor adults: 7.5-15 mg daily.\rIn elderly and debilitated patients: The recommended dose is 7.5 mg.\rIn premedication: 15 mg of Midazolam should be given 30-60 minutes before the procedure.\rIntravenous administration:\rEndoscopic or Cardiovascular Procedures: In healthy adults, the initial dose is approximately 2.5 mg. In cases of severe illness and in elderly patients, the initial dose must be reduced to 1 to 1.5 mg.\rInduction of Anesthesia: The dose is 10-15 mg.\rIntramuscular administration:\rAdult: 0.07-0.1 mg/kg body weight. The usual dose is about 5 mg.\rChildren: 0.15-0.20 mg/kg\rElderly and debilitated patients: 0.025-0.05 mg/kg\rRectal administration in children:\rFor preoperative sedation: Rectal administration of the ampoule solution (0.35-0.45 mg/kg) 20-30 min. before induction of general anesthesia.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMilam can enhance the central sedative effect of neuroleptics, tranquillizers, antidepressants, sleep-inducing drugs, analgesics, anaesthetics, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antiepileptic drugs and sedative antihistamines.\rContraindications\rMidazolam must not be given to patients with severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea syndrome and with known hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines or to any component of the product\rSide Effects\rAt the start of therapy, drowsiness during daytime, confusion, fatigue, headache and muscle weakness may occur which usually disappear with repeated administration. Following parenteral (IV or IM) administration of Milam, fluctuations in vital signs have been noted including respiratory depression, apnea, variations in blood pressure and pulse rate.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMidazolam should be avoided during pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative. Since Midazolam passes into breast milk, it should not be administered to breast-feeding mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMilam IV should be administered very slowly.\rOverdose Effects\rExtreme overdosage may lead to coma, areflexia, cardiorespiratory depression and apnea. The effects of overdosage can be controlled with benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.\rTherapeutic Class\rBenzodiazepine hypnotics, Benzodiazepine sedatives\rStorage Conditions\rProtect from light and moisture, store in cool and dry place.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free.

Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Losita should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Losita should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture. Keep the medicine out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nLosita is indicated in the-\r\nTreatment of major depressive episodes.\r\nTreatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.\r\nTreatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\r\nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder.\r\nTreatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\r\nPharmacology\r\nEscitalopram is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\r\nDosage\r\nSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r\n \nMajor depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r\n \nPanic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r\n \nSocial anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r\n \nGeneralised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r\n \nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\r\nContraindications\r\nEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18 to 64 years of age, who have all of the following:\rPersistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the patient wishes.\rMarked personal distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence of PE and poor control over ejaculation.\rPharmacology\rThe mechanism of action is thought to be related to inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin and subsequent potentiation of serotonin activity. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2C) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult (18 to 64 years of age): The recommended starting dose for all patients is 30 mg, taken as needed approximately 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is one dose every 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCNS active medicinal products: The use of Dumax in combination with CNS active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated in patients with premature ejaculation. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of Dumax and such medicinal products is required.\r PDE5 inhibitors: Tadalafil did not affect the pharmacokinetics of Dumax. Sildenafil caused slight changes in Dumax pharmacokinetics, which are not expected to be clinically significant. However, Dumax should be prescribed with caution in patients who use PDE5 inhibitors due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r Tamsulosin: Concomitant administration of single or multiple doses of 30 mg or 60 mg Dumax to patients receiving daily doses of Tamsulosin did not result in changes in the pharmacokinetics of Tamsulosin. However, Dumax should be prescribed with caution in patients who use alpha adrenergic receptor antagonists due to possible reduced orthostatic tolerance.\r Warfarin: There are no data evaluating the effect of chronic use of Warfarin with Dumax; therefore, caution is advised when Dumax is used in patients taking Warfarin chronically.\r Ethanol: Concomitant use of alcohol and Dumax could increase the chance or severity of adverse reactions such as dizziness, drowsiness, slow reflexes, or altered judgment. Combining alcohol with Dumax may increase these alcohol-related effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events such as syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Dumax.\rContraindications\rPatients with known hypersensitivity to Dapoxetine Hydrochloride.\rPatients with significant pathological cardiac conditions such as heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (second or third degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease of significant valvular disease.\rConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), thioridazine.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures.

Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCloron does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Cloron on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Cloron are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Cloron may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Cloron may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Cloron. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Cloron in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Cloron pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Cloron might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Cloron is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Cloron.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Cloron (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Cloron. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Cloron infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Cloron in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Cloron for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCloron does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Cloron on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Cloron are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Cloron may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Cloron may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Cloron.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Cloron in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Cloron for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCloron does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Cloron on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Cloron are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Cloron may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Cloron may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Cloron. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Cloron in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Cloron pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Cloron might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Cloron is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Cloron.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Cloron (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Cloron. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Cloron infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Cloron 1 mg Tablet\r\nIs Cloron 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nCloron 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Cloron 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Cloron 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Spiretic is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spiretic causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium and magnesium is retained.\rPharmacology\rSpironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+ K+ ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys.\rDosage & Administration\rEdema in adults (congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome): An initial daily dosage of 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. Combined therapy with other diuretics is indicated when more rapid diuresis is desired.\r Primary hyperaldosteronism: After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism has been established, Spironolactone may be administered in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, Spironolactone may be employed for long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.\r Essential hypertension: For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of Spironolactone administered in either single or divided doses is recommended.\r Hypokalemia: Spironolactone in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic-induced hypokalemia.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rACE inhibitors: Concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors with potassium-sparing diuretics has been associated with severe hyperkalemia.\r Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Corticosteroids, ACTH: Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia, may occur.\r Lithium: Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics.

        "description": "Indications\rLinarol is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults.\rAs monotherapy: in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindicated due to renal impairment.\rAs combination therapy: in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control.\rPharmacology\rLinagliptin is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation.\rDosage & Administration\rLinagliptin 5 mg once daily. If added to metformin, the dose of metformin should be maintained and linagliptin administered concomitantly. When used in combination with a sulfonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.\r Patients with renal impairment: No dose adjustment required. Linagliptin can be taken with or without a meal at any time of the day.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLinarol is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. The risk for clinically meaningful interactions by other medicinal products on Linarol is low and in clinical studies Linarol had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rThere may be hypoglycaemia, nasopharyngitis, cough and pancreatitis in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category B.

Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nLinagliptin 5 mg once daily. If added to metformin, the dose of metformin should be maintained and linagliptin administered concomitantly. When used in combination with a sulfonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.\r\n \nPatients with renal impairment: No dose adjustment required. Linagliptin can be taken with or without a meal at any time of the day.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nLinarol is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. The risk for clinically meaningful interactions by other medicinal products on Linarol is low and in clinical studies Linarol had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThere may be hypoglycaemia, nasopharyngitis, cough and pancreatitis in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. So, Linagliptin tablets should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

        "description": "Indications\rVitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\rDosage & Administration\rFor capsule: Adults:\rTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks.

        "description": "Indications\rCosec is indicated for the treatment of-\rGastric and duodenal ulcer\rNSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\rAs prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal and gastric ulcer\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease\rAcid-related dyspepsia\rSevere ulcerating reflux esophagitis\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration during general anesthesia\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome\rHelicobacter pylori-induced peptic ulcer.\rPeptex - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rOmeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It inhibits gastric acid secretion by blocking hydrogen-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours and inhibition of secretion lasts up to 72 hours. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days.\rDosage\rOral-\rBenign gastric and duodenal ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks in duodenal ulceration, 8 weeks in gastric ulceration; in severe or recurrent cases, dose to be increased to 40 mg daily; maintenance dose for recurrent duodenal ulcer, 20 mg once daily; in prevention of relapse in duodenal ulcer, 10-20 mg daily.\rNSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4 weeks, if not fully healed. 20 mg once daily is used as prophylaxis in patients with a history of NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcers.\rGastro-esophageal reflux disease: 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks, continued for further 4-8 weeks, if not fully healed; 40 mg once daily has been given for 8 weeks in gastro-esophageal reflux disease, refractory to other treatment; maintenance dose is 20 mg once daily.\rLong-term management of acid reflux disease: 10-20 mg daily.\rAcid-related dyspepsia: 10-20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks.\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: 40 mg on the preceding evening, then 40 mg 2-6 hours before surgery.\rZollinger-Ellison syndrome: Initially 60 mg once daily; usual range 20-120 mg daily (If daily dose is more than 80 mg, 2 divided dose should be used).\rHelicobacter pylori eradication regimen in peptic ulcer disease: Omeprazole is recommended at a dose of 20 mg twice daily in association with antimicrobial agents as detailed below: Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both three times a day for one week, or Clarithromycin 250 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg both twice a day for one week, or Amoxicillin 1 g and Clarithromycin 500 mg both twice a day for one week.\rPaeditaric use in severe ulcerating reflux esophagitis (Child>1 year): If body-weight 10-20 kg, 10-20 -mg once daily for 4-12 weeks; if body-weight over 20 kg, 20-40 mg once daily for 4-12 weeks.\r IV Injection-\rProphylaxis of acid aspiration: Omeprazole 40 mg to be given slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) as an intravenous injection, one hour before surgery.\rDuodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis: In patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis where oral medication is inappropriate, Omeprazole IV 40 mg once daily is recommended.\rZollinger- Ellison syndrome (ZES): In patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome the recommended initial dose of Omeprazole given intravenously is 60 mg daily. Higher daily doses may be required and the dose should be adjusted individually. When doses exceed 60 mg daily, the dose should be divided & given twice daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rDirection for use of IV Injection: Omeprazole lyophilized powder and water for injection is for intravenous administration only and must not be given by any other route. Omeprazole IV injection should be given as a slow intravenous injection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding 10 ml water for injection to the vial containing powder. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a period of at least 2 to 5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml/minute. Use only freshly prepared solution. The solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.\r Direction for use of IV Infusion: Omeprazole IV infusion should be given as an intravenous infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes or more. The contents of one vial must be dissolved in 100 ml saline for infusion or 100 ml 5% Dextrose for infusion. The solution should be used within 12 hours when Omeprazole is dissolved in saline and within 6 hours when dissolved in 5% Dextrose. The reconstituted solution should not be mixed or co-administered in the same infusion set with any other drug.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDue to the decreased intragastric acidity the absorption of ketoconazole may be reduced during Cosec treatment as it is during treatment with other acid secretion inhibitors. As Cosec is metabolised in the liver through cytochrome P450 it can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. Monitoring of patients receiving warfarin or pheytoin is recommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be necessary. However concomitant treatment with Cosec 20mg daily did not change the blood concentration of phenytoin in patients on continuous treatment with phenytoin. Similarly concomitant treatment with Cosec 20mg daily did not change coagulation time in patients on continuous treatment with warfarin. Plasma concentrations of Cosec and clarithromycin are increased during concomitant administration. This is considered to be a useful interaction during H. pylori eardication. There is no evidence of an interaction with phenacetin, theophylline, caffeine, propranolol, metoprolol, cyclosporin, lidocaine, quinidine, estradiol, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Cosec is not affected by alcohol or food. There is no evidence of an interaction with piroxicam, diclofenac or naproxen. This is considered useful when patients are required to continue these treatments. Simultaneous treatment with Cosec and digoxin in healthy subjects lead to a 10% increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a consequence of the increased intragastric pH.\rContraindications\rOmeprazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it. When gastric ulcer is suspected, the possibility of malignancy should be excluded before treatment with omeprazole is instituted, as treatment may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis.\rSide Effects\rCosec is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been mild and reversible. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported. Usually resolving after discontinuation of treatment. In addition photosensitivity, bullous eruption, erythema multiforme, angioedema and alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhoea and headache have been reported and may be severe enough to require discontinuation of therapy in a small number of patients. In the majority of cases the symptoms resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Other gastrointestinal reactions have included constipation, nausea/vomiting, flatulence and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, stomatitis and candidiasis have been reported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia has been reported. Dizziness, light headedness and feeling faint have been associated with treatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy. Also reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have occurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic symptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when therapy is stopped. In isolated cases, the following have been reported: blurred vision, taste disturbance, peripheral oedema, increased sweating, gynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anaphylactic shock, malaise, fever, bronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe liver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial nephritis and hepatic failure. Increases in liver enzymes have been observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rResults from three prospective epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/newborn child. Omeprazole can be used during pregnancy. There is no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into breast milk or its effects on the neonate. Breast-feeding should, therefore, be discontinued, if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\r Use in Children & Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAvoid concomitant use of clopidogrel and Cosec as the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel is reduced if given concomitantly. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis- related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. Atrophic gastritis has been noted occasionally in gastric corpus biopsies from patients treated long-term with Cosec. Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may lead to methotrexate toxicities.\rTherapeutic Class\rProton Pump Inhibitor\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rEssential hypertension: Amlocard is efficacious as monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension. It may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\r Angina pectoris: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents.\r Vasospastic angina: Amlocard is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: Usual dose is 5 mg once daily. The maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.\r Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic): 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg.\r Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug Interactions-\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Little or no data are available in patients with markedly impaired cardiac left ventricular function; however, as with other calcium antagonist drugs, the combination of Amlocard and p-blockers should be avoided in such patients.\rOther Significant Interactions-\rDigoxin: Absence of any interaction between Amlocard and Digoxin in healthy volunteers has been documented in a controlled clinical study.\rCimetidine: An unpublished clinical study indicated no interaction between, Amlocard and Cimetidine in healthy volunteers.\rWarfarin: An unpublished clinical study in healthy volunteers indicates that Amlocard did not significantly alter the effect of Warfarin on prothrombin time.\rFood: Food does not alter the rate or extent of absorption of Amlocard.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to dihydropyridine derivatives. Pregnant woman.\rSide Effects\rThe most common adverse effects of amlodipine are associated with vasodilatory action, such as dizziness, flushing, headache, hypotension and peripheral edema. Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Amlocard may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Amlodipine in pregnant women. Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPrecaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren with hypertension from 6 years to 17 years of age: 2.5 mg once daily as a starting dose, up-titrated to 5 mg once daily if blood pressure goal is not achieved after 4 weeks. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.\r Children under 6 years old:  The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.\r Elderly: Amlocard used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients is equally well tolerated. Normal dosage regimens are recommended in the elderly, but increase of the dosage should take place with care.\r Renal impairment: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment, therefore the normal dosage is recommended. Amlocard is not dialysable.\r Hepatic impairment: Dosage recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment; therefore dose selection should be cautions and should start at the lower end of the dosing range. The pharmacokinetics of Amlocard have not been studied in severe hepatic impairment. Amlocard should be initiated at the lowest dose (2.5 mg once daily) and titrated slowly in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\r Management: Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. \r A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.\rTherapeutic Class\rCalcium-channel blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep all medicines out of reach of children.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Xetril in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Xetril for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rXetril does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Xetril on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Xetril are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Xetril may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Xetril may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Xetril. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Xetril in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Xetril pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Xetril might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Xetril is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Xetril.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Xetril (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Xetril. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Xetril infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Xetril 0.5 mg Tablet\rIs Xetril 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rXetril 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Xetril 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Xetril 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rNightus is indicated in-\rEmotional disturbances, i.e. acute tension and anxiety states. Difficulties in interpersonal contact. Agitation, insomnia, anxious and agitated depressive reactions.\rFunctional disturbances in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, i.e. pseudoangina pectoris, pericardial anxiety, tachycardia, emotiogenic hypertension, dyspnea and hyperventilation.\rDisturbances in the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. irritable bowel syndrome, epigastric pain, spasm, bloating diarrhea etc.\rDisturbances in the urinary tract, i.e. frequency, irritable bladder and dysmenorrhea.\rPsychosomatic disorder, i.e. psychogenic headache, asthma, gastric and duodenal ulcer.\rIt is also indicated in emotional reactions to chronic organic disease.\rPharmacology\rBromazepam is a powerful psychotropic agent. In lower dosage, it selectively reduces tension and anxiety. In higher dosage, it shows sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced.\rDosage\rStandard dosage: Average dosage for outpatient therapy is 1.5-3 mg up to three times daily. Treatment of outpatients should begin with low doses, gradually increasing to the optimum level.\r In severe cases, especially in hospital: 6-12 mg 2 or 3 times daily. The overall treatment generally should not be more than 8-12 weeks. In certain cases extension beyond the maximum treatment period may be necessary; if so, it should be taken with re-evaluation of the patient's status with special expertise.\r Elderly and debilitated patients: Elderly patients and those with impaired hepatic functions require lower doses.\r Children: Bromazepam is usually not indicated in children, but if the physician feels bromazepam treatment is appropriate, then the dose should be adjusted to their low bodyweight (about 0.1-0.3 mg/kg bodyweight)\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rBromazepam tablets are for oral administration\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIf Nightus is combined with other centrally active drugs, its sedative effects may be enhanced. These drugs are antidepressants, hypnotics, narcotics, antipsychotics, sedatives, antiepileptic drugs, sedative antihistamines and anesthetics. Co-administration of cimetidine may prolong the eliminiation half-life of Nightus. Concomitant intake of Nightus with alcohol should be avoided, because the sedative effect of Nightus may be intensified by alcohol.\rContraindications\rBromazepam is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bromazepam, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency or sleep apnea syndrome.\rSide Effects\rCommon side-effects include fatigue, drowsiness, muscle weakness, numbed muscle, reduced alertness, confusion, headache, ataxia etc. These phenomena occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with prolonged administration. Anterograde amnesia may occur using therapeutic doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety of bromazepam during pregnancy has not been established. As bromazepam is excreted in breast milk, use should be avoided during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine like agents may lead to the development of physical and psychological dependence upon these products. This dependence depends on the dose and duration of treatment; it is also greater in predisposed patients with a history of alcohol. Once physical dependence has developed, termination of the treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headache, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, confusion and irritability. Since the risk of withdrawal phenomena and rebound phenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of the treatment, it is recommended that the dosage be decreased gradually. Nightus is not recommended for the primary treatment of sleeplessness caused by psychotic illness. Caution should be exercised while driving cars or using machineries.\rTherapeutic Class\rBenzodiazepine sedatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rNervalin is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rNervalin CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Nervalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Nervalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Nervalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Nervalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Nervalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Nervalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Nervalin is rapidly discontinued. Nervalin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Nervalin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Nervalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Nervalin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Nervalin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route.

Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Nervalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Nervalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Nervalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Nervalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Nervalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe depression associated with moderate to severe anxiety. Symptoms likely to respond in the first week of treatment include insomnia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety, suicidal ideation and anorexia.\rPharmacology\rAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and Chlordiazepoxide is an anxiolytic. Amitriptyline inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. This interference with the reuptake is responsible for the antidepressant activity of Amitriptyline. Chlordiazepoxide works by enhancing GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative and anxiolytic effect.\rDosage & Administration\rOptimum dosage varies with the severity of the symptoms and the response of the individual patient. When a satisfactory response is obtained, the dosage should be reduced to the smallest amount needed to maintain the remission. The larger portion of the total daily dose may be taken at bedtime. In some patients, a single dose at bedtime may be sufficient. This tablet in an initial dosage of 3 or 4 tablets daily in divided doses is satisfactory. Or directed by the physican.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBecause of its Amitriptyline component, Emijoy may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or compounds with a similar mechanism of action.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants. It should not be given concomitantly with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.\rSide Effects\rSide effects: Many symptoms common to the depressive state, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, restlessness and lethargy, have been reported as side effects of treatment with Emijoy.\r Adverse reactions: Most frequently reported were drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness and bloating. Less commonly included vivid dreams, impotence, tremor, confusion and nasal congestion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafe use of this preparation during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse with caution in patients with a history of seizures. Close supervision is required when Emijoy is given to hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication. The usual precautions should be observed when treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. All pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. Anyone considering the use of Chlordiazepoxide and Amitriptyline Hydrochloride Tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.\r Geriatric Use: In elderly and debilitated patients it is recommended that dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, over sedation, confusion or anticholinergic effects.\rOverdose Effects\rDeaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Critical manifestations of Amitriptyline overdose include cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions and CNS depression, including coma. Manifestations of benzodiazepine overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma and diminished reflexes.\r Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of Chlordiazepoxide. Generally, milder withdrawal symptoms (eg, dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache and malaise) have also been reported in association with abrupt Amitriptyline discontinuation.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined anxiolytics & anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.

In combination the compounds render a preparation with antidepressant, anxiolytic and activating properties. Maximal serum concentration is reached in about 4 hours after oral administration of flupentixol and in about 4 hours after oral administration of melitracen. The biological half-life of flupentixol is about 35 hours and that of melitracen is about 19 hours. The combination of flupentixol and melitracen does not seem to influence the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual compounds.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults: Usually 2 tablets orally daily in the morning and noon. In severe cases, the morning dose may be increased to 2 tablets.\r\n \nElderly patients: 1 tablet in the morning.\r\n \nMaintenance dose: Usually 1 tablet orally in the morning. In cases of insomnia or severe restlessness, additional treatment with a sedative in the acute phase is recommended.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nThis tablet may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Simultaneous administration of MAO-inhibitors may cause hypertensive crises. Neuroleptics and thymoleptics reduce the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similar acting compounds and thymoleptics enhance the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline.\r\nContraindications\r\nThe immediate recovery phase after myocardial infarction.\r\nDefects in bundle-branch conduction.\r\nUntreated narrow-angle glaucoma.\r\nAcute alcohol, barbiturate and opiate intoxications.\r\nThis tablet should not be given to patients who have received an MAO-inhibitor within two weeks.\r\nNot recommended for excitable or overactive patients since its activating effect may lead to exaggeration of these characteristics.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn the recommended doses side effects are rare. These could be transient restlessness and insomnia.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis tablet should preferably not be given during pregnancy and lactation.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIf previously the patient has been treated with tranquillizers with sedative effect these should be withdrawn gradually.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn cases of overdosage the symptoms of intoxications by melitracen, especially of anticholinergic nature, dominate. More rarely extrapyramidal symptoms due to flupentixol occur. Symptomatic and Supportive. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible and activated charcoal may be administered. Measures aimed at supporting the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be instituted. Epinephrine (adrenaline) must not be used for such patients. Convulsions may be treated with diazepam and extrapyramidal symptoms with biperiden.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined anxiolytics & anti-depressant drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at a temperature not exceeding 30°C in a dry place.

It is not effective in relieving migraine attacks once in progress.\rDescription\rPizo-A is a tricyclic compound. It antagonizes serotonin receptor competitively. It possesses antihistamine, antibradykinin and weak anticholinergic properties. It also possesses appetite-stimulating properties.\rPharmacology\rPizotifen works by inhibiting the peripheral actions of serotonin and histamine in increasing the membrane permeability of cranial vessels and transudation of plasmakinin, while altering pain thresholds in migraines. By blocking 5-HT receptors, pizotifen attenuates the signalling of serotonin in causing cranial vasoconstriction, as well as serotonin-enhanced platelet function and aggregation. There is evidence that it also inhibits the peripheral actions of bradykinin. Pizotifen may inhibit serotonin reuptake by blood platelets, which affects the tonicity and decreases passive distension of extracranial arteries. The effects of pizotifen leading to appetite stimulation may be due to the drug acting at the metabolic level rather than a direct stimulation of the appetite centre.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Usually 1.5 mg daily. This may be taken as a single dose at night or in three divided doses. Dosage should be adjusted to the individual patient requirements up to a maximum of 4.5 mg daily.

        "description": "Indications\rNeugalin is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rNeugalin CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Neugalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neugalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neugalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neugalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neugalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neugalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neugalin is rapidly discontinued. Neugalin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neugalin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neugalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neugalin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Neugalin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Neugalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neugalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neugalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neugalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neugalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neugalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neugalin is rapidly discontinued. Neugalin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neugalin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neugalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neugalin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Neugalin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neugalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neugalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neugalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neugalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neugalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neugalin is rapidly discontinued. Neugalin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neugalin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neugalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neugalin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Neugalin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome. It is useful in relieving many of the symptoms of parkinsonism, particularly rigidity and bradykinesia. This tablet is frequently helpful in the management of tremor, dysphagia, sialorrhea and postural instability associated with Parkinson's disease and syndrome. Levodopa plus carbidopa before physiotherapy increases motor recovery after stroke.\rDescription\rLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of Levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more Levodopa becomes available to the brain.\rDosage & Administration\rIf 100/10 mg tablet is used: Dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. Titration upward may be required in some patients to achieve optimum dosage of carbidopa. The dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (two tablets q.d.s.) is reached.\r For patients starting with 250/25 mg tablet: The initial dose is one half taken once or twice daily. However, this may not provide the optimal amount of Carbidopa needed by many patients. If necessary, add one-half every day or every other day until optimal response is reached. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of Levodopa a day is one tablet of 250/25 mg three or four times a day.\r Maintenance dose: Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. When more levodopa is requried, 250/25 mg tablet should be substituted at a dosage of one tablet three or four times a day. If necessary, the dosage of 250/25 mg tablet may be increased by half to one tablet every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with a total daily dosage greater than 200 mg Carbidopa is limited.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when Carbidopa-Levodopa is added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive medicines. Therefore, when therapy with CarbidopaLevodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive medicine may be required. There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and Carbidopa-Levodopa. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of Carbidopa and/or Levodopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate. Dopamine-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones and risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of Levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of Levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicines with Carbidopa-Levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and Carbidopa-Levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to Carbidopa-Levodopa alone.\rContraindications\rCarbidopa-Levodopa tablet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Carbidopa and Levodopa, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Since Levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Carbidopa-Levodopa should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects that occur frequently in patients receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa are those due to the central neuropharmacologic activity of dopamine. These reactions usually can be diminished by dosage reduction. The most common adverse effects are dyskinesias including choreiform, dystonic, and other involuntary movements and nausea.\rBody as a whole: syncope, chest pain, anorexia.\rCardiovascular: palpitation, orthostatic effects including hypotensive episodes, hypertension, phlebitis.\rGastrointestinal: vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, diarrhoea, dark saliva.\rHaemotologic: leukopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\rHypersensitivity: angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\rNervous System: dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia, delusions, hallucinations and paranoid ideation, depression with or without development of suicidal tendencies, dementia, dream abnormalities, agitation, confusion, increased libido.\rRespiratory: dyspnea.\rSkin: alopecia, rash, dark sweat.\rUrogenital: dark urine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAlthough the effects of CarbidopaLevodopa on human pregnancy are unknown both Levodopa and combinations of Carbidopa and Levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. Therefore, use of CarbidopaLevodopa in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the medicine be weighed against possible hazards should pregnancy occur. It is not known whether Carbidopa is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Carbidopa Levodopa may be given to patients already taking Levodopa alone; however, the Levodopa must be discontinued at least 12 hours before Carbidopa-Levodopa started. Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with Levodopa alone because Carbidopa permits more Levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Carbidopa-Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions.\r Care should be exercised to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have atriai, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with Carbidopa-Levodopa, provided the intraocular pressure is weli controlled and the patient monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Carbidopa-Levodopa in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 years is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome.

Since Levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Carbidopa-Levodopa should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAdverse effects that occur frequently in patients receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa are those due to the central neuropharmacologic activity of dopamine. These reactions usually can be diminished by dosage reduction. The most common adverse effects are dyskinesias including choreiform, dystonic, and other involuntary movements and nausea.\r\nBody as a whole: syncope, chest pain, anorexia.\r\nCardiovascular: palpitation, orthostatic effects including hypotensive episodes, hypertension, phlebitis.\r\nGastrointestinal: vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, development of duodenal ulcer, diarrhoea, dark saliva.\r\nHaemotologic: leukopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\r\nHypersensitivity: angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.\r\nNervous System: dizziness, somnolence, paresthesia, delusions, hallucinations and paranoid ideation, depression with or without development of suicidal tendencies, dementia, dream abnormalities, agitation, confusion, increased libido.\r\nRespiratory: dyspnea.\r\nSkin: alopecia, rash, dark sweat.\r\nUrogenital: dark urine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAlthough the effects of CarbidopaLevodopa on human pregnancy are unknown both Levodopa and combinations of Carbidopa and Levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits. Therefore, use of CarbidopaLevodopa in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the medicine be weighed against possible hazards should pregnancy occur. It is not known whether Carbidopa is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Carbidopa Levodopa may be given to patients already taking Levodopa alone; however, the Levodopa must be discontinued at least 12 hours before Carbidopa-Levodopa started. Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with Levodopa alone because Carbidopa permits more Levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Carbidopa-Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions.\r\n \nCare should be exercised to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have atriai, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with Carbidopa-Levodopa, provided the intraocular pressure is weli controlled and the patient monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Carbidopa-Levodopa in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 years is not recommended.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAntiparkinson drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.",

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Leptic in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Leptic for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLeptic does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Leptic on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Leptic are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Leptic may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Leptic may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Leptic. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Leptic in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Leptic pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Leptic might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Leptic is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Leptic.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Leptic (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Leptic. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Leptic infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Leptic 0.5 mg Tablet\rIs Leptic 0.5 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rLeptic 0.5 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Leptic 0.5 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Leptic 0.5 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLeptic does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital.

During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy.

Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Leptic may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Leptic may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Leptic.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Leptic in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Leptic for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nLeptic does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Leptic on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Leptic are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Leptic may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Leptic may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Leptic. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Leptic in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Leptic pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Leptic might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Leptic is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Leptic.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins.

It is a selective calcium channel antagonist. By reducing excessive transmembrane influx of calcium Flunarizine prevents cellular calcium overload. It does not interfere with normal cellular calcium homeostasis. Flunarizine also has some antihistaminic and sedative properties. It binds at an affinity of 99% to plasma protein.\rDosage & Administration\rMigraine Prophylaxis:\rStarting Dose: 10 mg at night in patients less than 65 years of age and 5 mg daily in patients older than 65 years. If, during this treatment depressive, extrapyramidal or other unacceptable symptoms occur, administration should be discontinued. If, after 2 months of this initial treatment, no significant improvement is observed, the patient should be considered a non-responder and administration should be discontinued.\rMaintenance Treatment: If a patient is responding satisfactorily and if a maintenance treatment is needed, the dose should be decreased to 5 days treatment at the same daily dose with two successive medicine free days every week. Even if the prophylactic maintenance treatment is successful and well tolerated, it should be interrupted after 6 months and it should be re-initiated only if the patient relapses.\rPeripheral Vascular disease: 10 mg twice daily, up to 30 mg per day if required.\r Vertigo & motion sickness: 10-20 mg daily for adults and 5 mg daily for children (> 40 kg).\r Epileptic seizure: 15-20 mg daily in adults and 5 to 10 mg daily for children as an add-on therapy\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rGalactorrhoea has been reported in few women on oral contraceptives within the first two months of Fluzin treatment. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as Carbamazepine and Phenytoin may interact with Fluzin by increasing its metabolism. So an increase in dosage of Fluzin may be required.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to Flunarizine. Flunarizine is contra-indicated in patients with a history of depressive illness, or with pre-existing symptoms of Parkinson's disease or other extrapyramidal disorders.\rSide Effects\rDrowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Fluzin: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk. Infrequently reported adverse reaction are: heartburn; nausea; gastralgia; insomnia; anxiety; galactorrhoea; dry mouth; muscle ache; skin rash.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSafety in pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rFluzin may lead to drowsiness which is aggravated by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Fluzin is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Fluzin. This treatment may give rise to extrapyramidal and depressive symptoms and reveal Parkinsonism, especially in predisposed patients such as the elderly. Fluzin should therefore be used with caution in such patients.\rTherapeutic Class\rMiscellaneous prophylactic migraine preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It binds at an affinity of 99% to plasma protein.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nMigraine Prophylaxis:\r\nStarting Dose: 10 mg at night in patients less than 65 years of age and 5 mg daily in patients older than 65 years. If, during this treatment depressive, extrapyramidal or other unacceptable symptoms occur, administration should be discontinued. If, after 2 months of this initial treatment, no significant improvement is observed, the patient should be considered a non-responder and administration should be discontinued.\r\nMaintenance Treatment: If a patient is responding satisfactorily and if a maintenance treatment is needed, the dose should be decreased to 5 days treatment at the same daily dose with two successive medicine free days every week. Even if the prophylactic maintenance treatment is successful and well tolerated, it should be interrupted after 6 months and it should be re-initiated only if the patient relapses.\r\nPeripheral Vascular disease: 10 mg twice daily, up to 30 mg per day if required.\r\n \nVertigo & motion sickness: 10-20 mg daily for adults and 5 mg daily for children (> 40 kg).\r\n \nEpileptic seizure: 15-20 mg daily in adults and 5 to 10 mg daily for children as an add-on therapy\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nGalactorrhoea has been reported in few women on oral contraceptives within the first two months of Fluzin treatment. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as Carbamazepine and Phenytoin may interact with Fluzin by increasing its metabolism. So an increase in dosage of Fluzin may be required.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to Flunarizine. Flunarizine is contra-indicated in patients with a history of depressive illness, or with pre-existing symptoms of Parkinson's disease or other extrapyramidal disorders.\r\nSide Effects\r\nDrowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Fluzin: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk. Infrequently reported adverse reaction are: heartburn; nausea; gastralgia; insomnia; anxiety; galactorrhoea; dry mouth; muscle ache; skin rash.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nSafety in pregnancy and lactation has not been established.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nFluzin may lead to drowsiness which is aggravated by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Fluzin is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Fluzin. This treatment may give rise to extrapyramidal and depressive symptoms and reveal Parkinsonism, especially in predisposed patients such as the elderly. Fluzin should therefore be used with caution in such patients.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nMiscellaneous prophylactic migraine preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\rDosage\rSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r Major depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain an antidepressant response. After the symptoms resolve, treatment for at least 6 months is required for consolidation of the response.\r Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: An initial dose of 5 mg is recommended for the first week before increasing the dose to 10 mg daily. The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Elodep should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture.

The dose may be further increased, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily, dependent on individual patient response. Maximum effectiveness is reached after about 3 months. The treatment lasts several months.\r Social anxiety disorder: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily. Usually, 2-4 weeks are necessary to obtain symptom relief. The dose may subsequently, depending on individual patient response, be decreased to 5 mg or increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Social anxiety disorder is a disease with a chronic course, and treatment for 12 weeks is recommended to consolidate response. Long-term treatment of responders has been studied for 6 months and can be considered on an individual basis to prevent relapse; treatment benefits should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Social anxiety disorder is a well-defined diagnostic terminology of a specific disorder, which should not be confounded with excessive shyness. Pharmacotherapy is only indicated if the disorder interferes significantly with professional and social activities. The place of this treatment compared to cognitive behavioural therapy has not been assessed. Pharmacotherapy is part of an overall therapeutic strategy.\r Generalised anxiety disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. Long term treatment of responders has been studied for at least 6 months in patients receiving 20 mg/day. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Initial dosage is 10 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg daily. As OCD is a chronic disease, patients should be treated for a sufficient period to ensure that they are symptom-free. Treatment benefits and dose should be re-evaluated at regular intervals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rEscitalopram should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs SSRI or related antidepressants should not be started until 2 weeks after stopping an MAOI. Conversely, an MAOI should not. be started until at least a week after an SSRI or related antidepressant has been stopped (2 weeks in the case of paroxetine and sertraline, at least 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).\rContraindications\rEscitalopram is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Escitalopram or Citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients of the drug product. Concomitant use of escitalopram in patients taking monoamine oxidase/pimozide is contraindicated.\rSide Effects\rSSRIs are less sedating and have fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. Side-effects of the SSRIs include gastrointestinal effects (dose-related and fairly common include nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), anorexia with weight loss (increased appetite and weight gain also reported) and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, arthralgia, myalgia, and photosensitivity; other side-effects include dry mouth, nervousness, anxiety, headache, insomnia, tremor, dizziness, asthenia, hallucinations, drowsiness, convulsions, galactorrhoea, sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, sweating, hypomania or mania, movement disorders and dyskinesias, visual disturbances.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen treating a pregnant woman with Escitalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. It is excreted in human breast milk. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Escitalopram therapy should take into account the risk of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits Escitalopram treatment for the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSSRIs should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, discontinue if convulsions develop), concurrent electroconvulsive therapy (prolonged seizures reported with fluoxetine), history of mania, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, angle-closure glaucoma, concomitant use of drugs that increase risk of bleeding, history of bleeding disorders (especially gastro-lntestinal bleeding), hepatic and renal impairment.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly patients (>65 years of age): Initial dosage is 5 mg once daily. Depending on the individual patient response the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. The efficacy of escitalopram in social anxiety disorder has not been studied in elderly patients.\r Children and adolescents (<18 years): Elodep should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.\r Reduced renal function: Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severely reduced renal function (CLCR less than 30 ml/min).\r Reduced hepatic function: An initial dose of 5 mg daily for the first two weeks of treatment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Caution and extra careful dose titration is advised in patients with severely reduced hepatic function.\r Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19: For patients who are known to be poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C19, an initial dose of 5 mg daily during the first two weeks of treatment is recommended. Depending on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. Discontinuation symptoms seen when stopping treatment. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.\r When stopping treatment with escitalopram the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Symptoms seen in a reported overdose of escitalopram include symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (ranging from dizziness, tremor, and agitation to rare cases of serotonin syndrome, convulsion, and coma), the gastrointestinal system (nausea/vomiting), and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, tachycardia, QT interval, prolongation, and arrhythmia) and electrolyte/fluid balance conditions (hypokalaemia, hyponatremia).\r Management: There is no specific antidote. Establish and maintain an airway, ensure adequate oxygenation and respiratory function. Gastric lavage and the use of activated charcoal should be considered. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible after oral ingestion. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring are recommended along with general symptomatic supportive measures. ECG monitoring is advised in case of overdose, in patients with congestive heart failure/bradyarrhythmias, in patients using concomitant medications that prolong the QT-interval, or in patients with altered metabolism, e.g. liver impairment.\rTherapeutic Class\rSSRIs & related anti-depressant drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 30°C temperature and protect from light & moisture. Keep the medicine out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nElodep is indicated in the-\r\nTreatment of major depressive episodes.\r\nTreatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.\r\nTreatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\r\nTreatment of generalised anxiety disorder.\r\nTreatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\r\nPharmacology\r\nEscitalopram is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Escitalopram is the pure S-enantiomer of the racemic bicyclic phthalate derivative citalopram. Escitalopram is at least 100 fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic Dopamine, Histamine, Muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors.\r\nDosage\r\nSafety of daily doses above 20 mg has not been demonstrated. Escitalopram Oxalate is administered as a single daily dose and may be taken with or without food.\r\n \nMajor depressive episodes: Usual dosage is 10 mg once daily.

When Dulox was co-administered with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, the AUC, Cmax and t of Dulox was increased. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism include cimetidine and quinolone antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin would be expected to have similar effects and these combinations should be avoided. Because CYP2D6 is involved in Dulox metabolism, concomitant use of Dulox with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of Dulox.\rContraindications\rDuloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug or any of the inactive ingredients. Duloxetine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Duloxetine should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease. In clinical trials, Duloxetine was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis; therefore, it should be used cautiously in patients with controlled narrow-angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly observed adverse events in Dulox treated patients were nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, fatigue, somnolence, increased sweating, hyperhidrosis and asthenia. It may slightly increase blood pressure. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, and QRS intervals between Dulox-treated and placebo-treated patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Pregnancy Category C.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, Duloxetine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Labor and Delivery: The effect of Duloxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Duloxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: It is unknown whether or not Duloxetine and/or it's metabolites are excreted into human milk, but nursing while on Duloxetine is not recommended\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAll patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes. Blood pressure should be measured prior to initiating treatment and periodically measured throughout treatment. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Dulox and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Dulox should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Dulox should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in the pediatric population: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established\rOverdose Effects\rThere is limited clinical experience with Dulox overdose in humans. There is no specific antidote to Dulox. In case of acute overdose, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug. An adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation should be assured, and cardiac rhythm and vital signs should be monitored. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting the absorption of Dulox from the gastrointestinal tract.\rTherapeutic Class\rSerotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30°C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nDulox is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) indicated for-\r\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD)\r\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\r\nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP)\r\nFibromyalgia and\r\nChronic Musculoskeletal Pain.\r\nPharmacology\r\nDuloxetine Hydrochloride is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) for oral administration. Duloxetine is a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors in vitro. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). Orally administered Duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. Elimination of Duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD)-\r\nStarting Dose: 40 mg/day to 60 mg/day\r\nTarget Dose: Acute: 40 mg/day (20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (once daily or as 30 mg twice daily); Maintenance: 60 mg/day\r\nMaximum Dose: 120 mg/day\r\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-\r\nStarting Dose: 60 mg/day\r\nTarget Dose: 60 mg/day (once daily)\r\nMaximum Dose: 120 mg/day\r\nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP)-\r\nStarting Dose: 60 mg/day\r\nTarget Dose: 60 mg/day (once daily)\r\nMaximum Dose: 60 mg/day\r\nFibromyalgia-\r\nStarting Dose: 30 mg/day\r\nTarget Dose: 60 mg/day (once daily)\r\nMaximum Dose: 60 mg/day\r\nChronic Musculoskeletal Pain-\r\nStarting Dose: 30 mg/day\r\nTarget Dose: 60 mg/day (once daily)\r\nMaximum Dose: 60 mg/day\r\nSome patients may benefit from starting at 30 mg once daily. There is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confers an additional benefit, while some adverse reactions were observed to be dose-dependent. A gradual dose reduction is recommended to avoid discontinuation symptoms.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nBoth CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes are responsible for Dulox metabolism. When Dulox was co-administered with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, the AUC, Cmax and t of Dulox was increased. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism include cimetidine and quinolone antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin would be expected to have similar effects and these combinations should be avoided. Because CYP2D6 is involved in Dulox metabolism, concomitant use of Dulox with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of Dulox.\r\nContraindications\r\nDuloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug or any of the inactive ingredients. Duloxetine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Duloxetine should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease. In clinical trials, Duloxetine was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis; therefore, it should be used cautiously in patients with controlled narrow-angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most commonly observed adverse events in Dulox treated patients were nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, fatigue, somnolence, increased sweating, hyperhidrosis and asthenia. It may slightly increase blood pressure. No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, and QRS intervals between Dulox-treated and placebo-treated patients.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category C.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilized on levodopa/dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor treatment.\rComposition\rEach tablet contains a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone (mg of carbidopa per mg of levodopa per mg of entacapone). For example-\rStalevo 50 (12.5 mg per 50 mg per 200 mg)\rStalevo 75 (18.75 mg per 75 mg per 200 mg)\rStalevo 100 (25 mg per 100 mg per 200 mg)\rStalevo 125 (31.25 mg per 125 mg per 200 mg)\rStalevo 150 (37.5 mg per 150 mg per 200 mg)\rStalevo 200 (50 mg per 200 mg per 200 mg)\rPharmacology\rThis is a combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, it crosses the bloodbrain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more levodopa is available to the brain. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of catecholo-methyltransferase. Given concurrently, entacapone results in greater and more sustained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to greater control of parkinsonism symptoms.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: The optimum daily dose must be determined by careful titration of levodopa in each patient. Patients should be instructed to take only 1 tablet per dose administration. The maximum recommended daily dose of entacapone is 2,000 mg. Usually this tablet is to be used in patients who are currently treated with corresponding doses of standard release levodopa/DDC inhibitor and entacapone.\r Method of administration: Each tablet is to be taken orally either with or without food. One tablet contains one treatment dose and the tablet may only be administered as whole tablets.\r How to transfer patients taking levodopa/DDC inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide) preparations and entacapone tablets to this combination:\rPatients who are currently treated with entacapone and with standard release levodopa/carbidopa in doses equal to Tridopa tablet strengths can be directly transferred to corresponding Tridopa tablets. For example, a patient taking one tablet of 100 mg/25 mg of levodopa/carbidopa with one tablet of entacapone 200 mg four times daily can take one Tridopa 100 tablet four times daily in place of their usual levodopa/carbidopa and entacapone doses.\rWhen initiating Tridopa therapy for patients currently treated with entacapone and levodopa/carbidopa in doses not equal to Tridopa 100 (or Tridopa 50 or Tridopa 150 or Tridopa 200) tablets, Tridopa dosing should be carefully titrated for optimal clinical response. At the initiation, Tridopa should be adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the total daily dose of levodopa currently used.\rWhen initiating Tridopa in patients currently treated with entacapone and levodopa/benserazide in a standard release formulation, the dosing of levodopa/benserazide should be discontinued in the previous night, and Tridopa should be started in the next morning. The starting dose of Tridopa should provide either the same amount of levodopa or slightly (5-10%) more.\rHow to transfer patients not currently treated with entacapone to Tridopa:\rInitiation of Tridopa may be considered at corresponding doses to current treatment in some patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who are not stabilized on their current standard release levodopa/DDC inhibitor treatment. However, a direct switch from levodopa/DDC inhibitor to Tridopa is not recommended for patients who have dyskinesias or whose daily levodopa dose is above 800 mg. In such patients it is advisable to introduce entacapone treatment as a separate treatment (entacapone tablets) and adjust the levodopa dose if necessary, before switching to Tridopa.\rEntacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. It may therefore be necessary, particularly in patients with dyskinesia, to reduce levodopa dose by 10-30% within the first days to first weeks after initiating Tridopa treatment. The daily dose of levodopa can be reduced by extending the dosing intervals and/or by reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient.\rDose adjustment during the course of the treatment: When more levodopa is required, an increase in the frequency of doses and/or the use of an alternative strength of Tridopa should be considered, within the dose recommendations. When less levodopa is required, the total daily dose of Tridopa should be reduced either by decreasing the frequency of administration by extending the time between doses, or by decreasing the strength of Tridopa at an administration. If other levodopa products are used concomitantly with a Tridopa tablet, the maximum dose recommendations should be followed.\r Discontinuation of Tridopa therapy: If Tridopa treatment (levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) is discontinued and the patient is transferred to levodopa/DDC inhibitor therapy without entacapone, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rSymptomatic postural hypotension may occur when levodopa is added to the treatment of patients already receiving antihypertensive. Dose adjustment of the antihypertensive agent may be required. Dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. some antipsychotics and antiemetics), phenytoin and papaverine may reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa. Patients taking these medicinal products with levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone combination should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids, the absorption of Levodopa, Carbidopa & Entacapone may be impaired in some patients on high protein diet.\rContraindications\rLevodopa/carbidopa/entacapone combination is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, narrow-angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, coadministration with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B) inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine), a previous history of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and/or nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects include dyskinesia, nausea, hyperkinesia, change in urine color, diarrhea and stomach pain. Other side effects may include diarrhea, sometimes severe; colitis; hallucinations; other mental disturbances; orthostatic hypotension; rhabdomyolysis; and symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a condition characterized by high fever, muscle stiffness, and confusion); fibrosis; skin cancer, etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. The combination of levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The safety of this combination in the infant is not known. Women should not breast-feed during treatment with this combination.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLevodopa, carbidopa and entacapone together may cause dizziness and symptomatic orthostatism. Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines. As with levodopa, periodic evaluations of hepatic, hematopoietic, cardiovascular and renal function are recommended during extended therapy.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Elderly: No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients.\r Hepatic impaired patients: Should be administered cautiously to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Dose reduction may be needed.\r Renally impaired patients: Should be administered cautiously to patients in severe renal impairment including those receiving dialysis therapy\rOverdose Effects\rThe acute symptoms and signs of overdose include agitation, confusional state, coma, bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, Cheyne Stokes respiration, discolorations of skin, tongue and conjunctiva, and chromaturia. Management of acute overdose with levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone combination is similar to acute overdose with levodopa. Pyridoxine, however, is not effective in reversing the actions of levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone combination. Hospitalization is advised and general supportive measures should be employed with immediate gastric lavage and repeated doses of charcoal over time.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Introduction\rTridopa 100 is a prescription medicine used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This medicine helps to reduce excessive shaking by slowing down the body movements. It works by increasing the amount of chemical messenger that is needed to control abnormal movements. Tridopa 100 is taken with or without food, but better to avoid high protein meal and dairy products. However, it is advised to take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this medicine in the dose and duration advised by your doctor and if you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. You should never skip any doses and try to finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. It is important that this medication is not stopped suddenly without talking to the doctor as it can result in harmful effects. This medicine may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, constipation, discoloration of urine, and dryness in the mouth. It causes a sudden onset of dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. It is common to have diarrhea with this medicine, so drink plenty of fluids and watch for weight loss. Take caution while taking medicine if you are suffering from liver or kidney disease. Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding. ... \rUses of Tridopa 100\rParkinson&#x27;s disease\rSide effects of Tridopa 100\rCommon\rNausea\rVomiting\rConstipation\rUrine discoloration\rHeadache\rDryness in mouth\rInsomnia (difficulty in sleeping)\rOrthostatic hypotension (sudden lowering of blood pressure on standing)\rAnxiety\rDizziness\rAbnormality of voluntary movements\rAbnormal dreams\rHow to use Tridopa 100\rTake this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. Swallow it as a whole. Do not chew, crush or break it. Tridopa 100 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time. Avoid Tridopa 100 with high protein meals such as cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, protein powder, eggs and milk. ... \rHow Tridopa 100 works\rTridopa 100 is a combination of three medicines: Levodopa, Carbidopa and Entacapone which treat Parkinsonism. Levodopa is a Carbidopa precursor which gets converted to dopamine, a chemical messenger that controls movement in the brain. Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of Levodopa allowing it to enter the brain and increase dopamine levels. Entacapone is COMT inhibitor which causes higher and more sustained levels of levodopa in blood, leading to greater relief from the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. ... \rQuick Tips\rYou have been prescribed Tridopa 100 to treat your symptoms of parkinson's disease.\rAvoid a high-protein diet (eg.meat, poultry, and dairy products) while you are taking this medicine as that can reduce the amount of medication absorbed by your body. ... \rIt may cause dizziness or sleepiness. Don't drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you.\rTo lower the chance of feeling dizzy or passing out, rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down.\rDo not stop taking the medication suddenly without talking to your doctor. It may result in a serious syndrome that causes fever, stiff muscles, unusual body movements, sweating and confusion. ...\rTalk to your doctor in case you develop hallucinations or notice other changes in your behavior.\rBrief Description\rIndication\rParkinson's disease and 'end of dose' motor fluctuations\rAdministration\rMay be taken with or without food. Keep a consistent diet. A change in diet to foods high in protein may delay levodopa absorption & reduce amount taken up in circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying & thus delays levodopa absorption. Fe salts (eg in multivit prep) may also reduce amount of levodopa available to the body. Swallow whole. ... \rAdult Dose\rParkinson's disease Adult: PO: Each tab contains levodopa and carbidopa in a ratio of 4:1 and entacapone 200 mg: Initial: 1 tab/day.

This medicine helps to reduce excessive shaking by slowing down the body movements. It works by increasing the amount of chemical messenger that is needed to control abnormal movements. Tridopa 100 is taken with or without food, but better to avoid high protein meal and dairy products. However, it is advised to take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this medicine in the dose and duration advised by your doctor and if you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. You should never skip any doses and try to finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. It is important that this medication is not stopped suddenly without talking to the doctor as it can result in harmful effects. This medicine may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, constipation, discoloration of urine, and dryness in the mouth. It causes a sudden onset of dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. It is common to have diarrhea with this medicine, so drink plenty of fluids and watch for weight loss. Take caution while taking medicine if you are suffering from liver or kidney disease. Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy or breastfeeding. ... \r\nUses of Tridopa 100\r\nParkinson&#x27;s disease\r\nSide effects of Tridopa 100\r\nCommon\r\nNausea\r\nVomiting\r\nConstipation\r\nUrine discoloration\r\nHeadache\r\nDryness in mouth\r\nInsomnia (difficulty in sleeping)\r\nOrthostatic hypotension (sudden lowering of blood pressure on standing)\r\nAnxiety\r\nDizziness\r\nAbnormality of voluntary movements\r\nAbnormal dreams\r\nHow to use Tridopa 100\r\nTake this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. Swallow it as a whole. Do not chew, crush or break it. Tridopa 100 may be taken with or without food, but it is better to take it at a fixed time. Avoid Tridopa 100 with high protein meals such as cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, protein powder, eggs and milk. ... \r\nHow Tridopa 100 works\r\nTridopa 100 is a combination of three medicines: Levodopa, Carbidopa and Entacapone which treat Parkinsonism. Levodopa is a Carbidopa precursor which gets converted to dopamine, a chemical messenger that controls movement in the brain. Carbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of Levodopa allowing it to enter the brain and increase dopamine levels. Entacapone is COMT inhibitor which causes higher and more sustained levels of levodopa in blood, leading to greater relief from the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. ... \r\nQuick Tips\r\nYou have been prescribed Tridopa 100 to treat your symptoms of parkinson's disease.\r\nAvoid a high-protein diet (eg.meat, poultry, and dairy products) while you are taking this medicine as that can reduce the amount of medication absorbed by your body. ... \r\nIt may cause dizziness or sleepiness. Don't drive or do anything requiring concentration until you know how it affects you.\r\nTo lower the chance of feeling dizzy or passing out, rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down.\r\nDo not stop taking the medication suddenly without talking to your doctor. It may result in a serious syndrome that causes fever, stiff muscles, unusual body movements, sweating and confusion. ...\r\nTalk to your doctor in case you develop hallucinations or notice other changes in your behavior.\r\nBrief Description\r\nIndication\r\nParkinson's disease and 'end of dose' motor fluctuations\r\nAdministration\r\nMay be taken with or without food. Keep a consistent diet. A change in diet to foods high in protein may delay levodopa absorption & reduce amount taken up in circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying & thus delays levodopa absorption. Fe salts (eg in multivit prep) may also reduce amount of levodopa available to the body. Swallow whole. ... \r\nAdult Dose\r\nParkinson's disease Adult: PO: Each tab contains levodopa and carbidopa in a ratio of 4:1 and entacapone 200 mg: Initial: 1 tab/day. Titrate dose according to patient's response. Recommended to take only 1 tab per dose administration. Max: 8 tabs/day.

        "description": "Indications\rLamitrin is an antiepileptic drug (AED) indicated for:\r Epilepsy- adjunctive therapy in patients aged 2 years and older:\rPartial-onset seizures\rPrimary generalized tonic-clonic seizures\rGeneralized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\rEpilepsy- monotherapy in patients aged 16 years and older.\r Bipolar disorder- patients aged 18 years and older.\rDescription\rLamitrin is a phenyltriazine antiepileptic used to treat some types of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamitrin controls epileptic seizures by inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizes neuronal membranes and consequently inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g., glutamate and aspartate) release.\rPharmacology\rThe exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.\r Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.\r Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors. An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.\rDosage & Administration\rEpilepsy-\rTable-1:

        "description": "Indications\rLamitrin is an antiepileptic drug (AED) indicated for:\r Epilepsy- adjunctive therapy in patients aged 2 years and older:\rPartial-onset seizures\rPrimary generalized tonic-clonic seizures\rGeneralized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome\rEpilepsy- monotherapy in patients aged 16 years and older.\r Bipolar disorder- patients aged 18 years and older.\rDescription\rLamitrin is a phenyltriazine antiepileptic used to treat some types of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Lamitrin controls epileptic seizures by inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizes neuronal membranes and consequently inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter (e.g., glutamate and aspartate) release.\rPharmacology\rThe exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.\r Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.\r Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors. An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.\rDosage & Administration\rEpilepsy-\rTable-1:

        "description": "Indications\rGabarol is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rGabarol CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Gabarol is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Gabarol should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Gabarol should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Gabarol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Gabarol when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Gabarol may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Gabarol is rapidly discontinued. Gabarol should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Gabarol may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Gabarol and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Gabarol extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Gabarol, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Gabarol is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention).

Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Gabarol is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Gabarol should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Gabarol should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Gabarol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Gabarol when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Gabarol may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Gabarol is rapidly discontinued. Gabarol should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Gabarol may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Gabarol and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Gabarol extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Gabarol, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

Flunarizine is contra-indicated in patients with a history of depressive illness, or with pre-existing symptoms of Parkinson's disease or other extrapyramidal disorders.\rSide Effects\rDrowsiness and/or fatigue, as well as weight gain and/or increased appetite may occur. The following adverse experiences have been reported during chronic treatment with Fluver: depression, of which female patients with a history of depressive illness may be particularly at risk; extrapyramidal symptoms (such as bradykinesia, rigidity, akathisia, orofacial dyskinesia, tremor), of which elderly patients seem particularly at risk.

Patients should be cautioned against driving motor vehicles or performing other potentially hazardous tasks where a loss of mental alertness may lead to accidents. Fluver is not suited for aborting a migraine attack. The possible occurrence of an attack is therefore no reason to increase the dose of Fluver.

        "description": " Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Clonium in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Clonium for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Clonium in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Clonium for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Clonium in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Clonium for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nClonium does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Clonium on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Clonium are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Clonium may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Clonium may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Clonium. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Clonium in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Clonium pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Clonium might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Clonium is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Clonium.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Clonium (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Clonium. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Clonium infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

The effect of Clonium on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Clonium are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Clonium may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Clonium may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Clonium. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Clonium in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Clonium pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Clonium might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Clonium is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Clonium.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Clonium (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Clonium. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Clonium infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Clonium 1 mg Tablet\r\nIs Clonium 1 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nClonium 1 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Clonium 1 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Clonium 1 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rAtasin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and triglycerides levels in following diseases when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate.\rTo reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in patients with heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.\rTo reduce elevated cholesterol and triglycerides in patient with mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ia and Ib).\rFor the treatment of patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridaemia (Fredrickson Type IV).\rFor the treatment of patients with dysbetalipoproteinaemia (Fredrickson Type III).\rTo reduce cardiac ischaemic events in patients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate symptomatic coronary artery disease with elevated LDL-cholesterol level.\rTo reduce total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations patients with hypercholesterolemia associated with or exacerbated by diabetes mellitus or renal transplantation.\rPharmacology\rAtorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.\r Absorption: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.\r Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.\r Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\r Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rPrimary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia-\rAdults: Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily.\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily.\rFamilial hypercholesterolaemia-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).\rChild (10-18 years): Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily.\rPrevention of cardiovascular events-\rAdults: Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response.\r Another guideline: \r The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\r In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThe risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals.\r Antacid: When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35%. However, LDL-C reduction was not altered.\r Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C reduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.\r Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\r Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of atorvastatin and erythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.\r Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\r Warfarin: Atasin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.\rContraindications\rAtorvastatin should not be used in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. It is also contraindicated in patient with history of serious adverse reaction to prior administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.\rSide Effects\rAtasin is generally well-tolerated. The most frequent side effects related to Atasin are constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain. Other side effects includes infection, headache, back pain, rash, asthenia, arthralgia, myalgia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Safety in pregnant women has not been established. No controlled clinical trials with atorvastatin have been conducted in pregnant women. Rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been received. Animal studies have shown toxicity to reproduction. Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant\r Lactation: It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rats, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its active metabolites are similar to those in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Atasin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. Atasin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\rUse in Special Populations\rGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of Atasin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.\r Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\r Gender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with Atasin between men and women.\r Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of Atasin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.\r Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of Atasin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of Atasin are markedly increased.\rOverdose Effects\rSpecific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed their infants. Atorvastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLiver effects: Liver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Atasin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or have a history of liver disease. Atasin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of Atasin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults.\r\n \nPediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\r\n \nGender: There is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with Atasin between men and women.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of Atasin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.\r\n \nHemodialysis: Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of Atasin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of Atasin are markedly increased.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSpecific treatment is not available for atorvastatin overdose. The patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted, as required. Liver function tests should be performed and serum CK levels should be monitored. Due to extensive atorvastatin binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Anti-anginal & Anti-ischaemic drugs, Statins\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC33H35FN2O5\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Atorvastatin Calcium\r\nCommon Questions about Atasin 10 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Atasin 10 mg Tablet?\r\nAtasin 10 mg Tablet is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase.

The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rHydroxyzine Hydrochloride is an anxiolytic antihistamine of the piperazine class which is a H1 receptor antagonist. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.\rDosage & Administration\rFor symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension-\rAdults: 50-100 mg 4 times daily.\rChildren (>6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rPruritus due to allergic conditions-\rAdults: 25 mg 3 to 4 times daily.\rChildren ( 6 years): 50-100 mg (5-10 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rChildren (<6 years): 50 mg (5 teaspoonfuls) daily in divided doses.\rAs a sedative (premedication and following general anesthesia)-\rAdults: 50-100 mg.\rChildren: 0.6 mg/kg of body weight.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rArtica may potentiate Meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Artica is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. Simultaneous administration of Artica with monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided.\rContraindications\rHydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Hydroxyzine or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rSide effects reported with the administration of Artica Hhydrochloride are usually mild and transitory in nature. More common side effects include drowsiness, headache, psychomotor impairment, and antimuscarinic effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Other rare side-effects of antihistamines include hypotension, palpitation, arrhythmias, extrapyramidal effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, tremor, convulsions, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, rashes, and photosensitivity reactions), blood disorders, liver dysfunction, and angle-closure glaucoma.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rClinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, Hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe potentiating action of Artica must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with Artica, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of Artica, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Artica. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment patient: In case of renal impairment, half of the normal dose should be given.\r Use in the elderly patient: In the elderly, it is advised to start with half the recommended dose due to the prolonged action.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most common manifestation of Artica overdosage is hypersedation. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\r If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and Levarterenol or Metaraminol. Epinephrine should not be used as Artica counteracts its pressor action.\r There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with Artica. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route.

Pregnancy, lactation. Driving or working with machines, or do other dangerous activities.\r\n \nMode of Action\r\n \nPregabalin is an analog of the neurotransmitter GABA. It binds potently to the alpha2-delta subunit resulting in modulation of Ca channels and reduction in the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P.\r\n \nPrecaution\r\n \nAbrupt or rapid discontinuation of Pregabalin may produce some symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache and diarrhoea. So Pregabalin should be tapered gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinued abruptly. Pregabalin treatment may associate with creatine kinase elevations. It should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur. Discontinue treatment if patients develop severe angioedema. Regular vision check is recommended. May decrease platelet count and prolong PR interval. Patient w/ history of angioedema episodes, severe CV disease, renal impairment. Pregnancy and lactation. Patient Counselling May impair ability to drive, operate machinery or engage in hazardous activities. Monitoring Parameters Monitor visual disturbances.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability.

Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day.

It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Neurega is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neurega should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neurega should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neurega, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neurega when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neurega may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neurega is rapidly discontinued. Neurega should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neurega may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neurega and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neurega extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Neurega, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neurega should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neurega should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neurega, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neurega when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neurega may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neurega is rapidly discontinued. Neurega should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neurega may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neurega and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Pegalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Pegalin should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Pegalin should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Pegalin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Pegalin when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Pegalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Pegalin is rapidly discontinued. Pegalin should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Pegalin may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Pegalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Pegalin extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose with Pegalin, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Lopez is indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid cycling course\rPharmacology\rOlanzapine is an antipsychotic agent and has affinities for serotonin 5HT2A/2C, 5HT3, 5HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors M1-M5; α1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. The mechanism of action of Olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug’s efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Olanzapine is not mutagenic or clastogenic as well as not carcinogenic.\rDosage\rSchizophrenia, combination therapy for Mania, Bipolar Disorder: The initial dose is 5-10 mg once daily. Daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range of 5-20 mg daily. Dosage greater than 10 mg daily only after reassessment.

Drugs that induce CYP1A2 or glucoronyl transferase enzymes e.g, Omeprazole and Rifampicin, may increase Lopez clearance. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may potentially inhibit Lopez elimination. Carbamazepine may increase the clearance of Lopez. Concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of Lopez by 50-60%. Caution should be taken when Lopez is administered with centrally acting drugs and alcohol.\rContraindications\rOlanzapine is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the product as well as in patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rVery common undesirable effects are somnolence and weight gain. Besides increased appetite, elevated glucose levels, elevated triglyceride levels, dizziness, akathisia, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, mild and transient anticholinergic effects including constipation and dry mouth, asthenia, edema and photosensitivity reaction etc. may be observed.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rOlanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the foetus. So, patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Olanzapine. There is no report to show teratogenecity. Patients should not breast feed if they are taking Olanzapine.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLopez should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or have conditions associated with seizures. Lopez should be used cautiously in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, drug induced bone marrow depression/toxicity caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy, hypereosinophilic conditions, impaired hepatic function, and patients using hepatotoxic medicines, centrally acting drug and medicines know to increase QT interval, especially in the elderly.

        "description": " Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Epiclon in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epiclon for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects.

During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate.

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r\n \nIt is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r\n \nThe effectiveness of Epiclon in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Epiclon for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nEpiclon does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Epiclon on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Epiclon are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Epiclon may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Epiclon may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Epiclon. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Epiclon in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Epiclon pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Epiclon might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Epiclon is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Epiclon.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins.

        "description": "Indications\rHexinor is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\rDescription\rHexinor exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\rPharmacology\rTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r The total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r Use in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\rContraindications\rTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\rSide Effects\rMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Hexinor than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Hexinor. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Hexinor, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Hexinor has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients to be treated with Hexinor should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Hexinor should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\revidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Hexinor. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\rOverdose Effects\rIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Hexinor over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Hexinor blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r  Signs and Symptoms: Over dosage with Hexinor produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r Treatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Hexinor is dialyzable.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place.

Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl dosage of 3 to 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate. Concomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Trihexyphenidyl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of Trihexyphenidyl is increased.\r\n \nThe total daily intake of Trihexyphenidyl tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (>10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.\r\n \nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as , as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. The usual dose of either or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\r\nContraindications\r\nTrihexyphenidyl is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl. Trihexyphenidyl is also contraindicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness after long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Hexinor than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with Hexinor. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including Hexinor, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Hexinor has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no controlled data in animal or human pregnancy. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is only recommended for use during pregnancy when need has been clearly established and benefit outweighs risk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Trihexyphenidyl HCI is administered to a nursing woman. As with other anticholinergics, Trihexyphenidyl HCI may cause suppression of lactation. Therefore, Trihexyphenidyl HCI should only be used if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the infant.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients to be treated with Hexinor should have a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close monitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs may precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle glaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to aggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Hexinor should be administered with caution in hot weather, especially when given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, alcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those who do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is\r\nevidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium via perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have occurred with the use of anticholinergics under the conditions described above. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of Hexinor. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn humans, doses up to 300 mg (5 mg/kg) have been ingested without fatalities or sequelae. However, rare cases of death associated with Hexinor over dosages taken in conjunction with other CNS-depressant agents have been reported or in patients with a compromised respiratory condition. Hexinor blood concentrations associated with the fatalities ranged from 0.03 to 0.80 mg/I.\r\n \n \nSigns and Symptoms: Over dosage with Hexinor produces typical central symptoms of atropine intoxication (the central anticholinergic syndrome). Correct diagnosis depends upon recognition of the peripheral signs of parasympathetic blockade, including dilated and sluggish pupils; warm, dry skin; facial flushing; decreased secretions of the mouth, pharynx, nose, and bronchi; foul-smelling breath; elevated temperature; tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; decreased bowel sounds; and urinary retention. Neuropsychiatric signs such as delirium, disorientation, anxiety, hallucinations, illusions, confusion, incoherence, agitation, hyperactivity, ataxia, lip smacking and tasting movements, loss of memory, paranoia, combativeness, and seizures may be present. The condition can progress to stupor, coma, paralysis, cardiac and respiratory arrest, and death.\r\n \nTreatment: Treatment of acute overdose involves symptomatic and supportive therapy. Gastric lavage or other methods to limit absorption should be instituted. A small dose of diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be administered if CNS excitation is observed. Phenothiazines are contra-indicated because the toxicity may be intensified due to their antimuscarinic action, causing coma. Respiratory support, artificial respiration or vasopressor agents may be necessary. Hyperpyrexia must be reversed, fluid volume replaced and acid-balance maintained. Urinary catheterization may be necessary. It is not known if Hexinor is dialyzable.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAntiparkinson drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place. Protect from light.",

        "description": "Indications\rHexinor is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of Parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.\rDescription\rHexinor exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. It also has a relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system.\rPharmacology\rTrihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype. In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally. Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum. Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether Trihexyphenidyl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\r Idiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl form may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.\r Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Trihexyphenidyl dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Trihexyphenidyl therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced Trihexyphenidyl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after Trihexyphenidyl therapy was discontinued.\r Concomitant use with Levodopa: When Trihexyphenidyl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced.

The mechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested that its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\rDosage & Administration\rOral: Sodium Valproate tablets may be given once or twice daily and syrup should be given in divided doses.\r Epilepsy:\rAdult: Initially, 600 mg daily is given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day intervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily (20-30 mg/kg daily).\rChildren (over 20 kg)- Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (usually in the range of 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily.\rChildren (up to 20 kg)- Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses.\rFebrile convulsion: 20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.\r Bipolar disorder: Initially 600 mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day) in 2-3 divided doses. The maintenance dosage is 1000-2000 mg daily.\r Prophylaxis of migraine: 400-600 mg daily, although some may require 1000-1500 mg daily.\r Injection:\rAdults- May be given a slow intravenous injection over 3-5 minutes, usually 400-800 mg depending on body weight (up to 10 mg/kg) followed by continuous or repeated infusion up to a maximum of 2500 mg/day.\rFor children- Initial: 20-30 mg/kg/day, Maximum: 40 mg/kg/day. It may be given by direct slow intravenous injection or by infusion using compatible diluents e.g. 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection, 5% Dextrose injection.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEncorate Chrono Vaiproate appears to act as a non specific inhibitor of drug metabolism. Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\rContraindications\rSodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Use of Sodium Valproate is restricted during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Encorate Chrono Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Encorate Chrono.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSodium Vaiproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Encorate Chrono is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided. Encorate Chrono should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rTherapeutic Class\rPrimary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30°C.

It stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and potentiates its action in promoting reabsorption of water.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nEpilepsy:\r\nAdults and children over 12 years of age- Initial: Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and controlled release tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained.\r\nChildren 12-15 years of age- Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. Maintenance: usually 800-1200 mg daily.\r\nChildren 6-12 years of age- Initial: Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a b.i.d. or a t.i.d.or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance:usually 400-800 mg daily.\r\nChildren under 6 years of age- Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d.or t.i.d. as tablets, or q.i.d. as suspension. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.\r\nCombination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased.\r\n \nTrigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day,either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or controlled release tablets, or 50 mg (1/2 teaspoon) q.i.d. for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. A total dose of 1200 mg daily shouldn't be exceeded. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400-800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.

        "description": "Indications\rIdiopathic Parkinson's disease, in particular to reduce off-period in patients who previously have been treated with levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitors, or with levodopa alone and who have experienced motor fluctuations.\rDescription\rLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of Levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more Levodopa becomes available to the brain.\rDosage\rPatients currently treated with conventional levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combinations: Dosage with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should be substituted initially at an amount that provides no more than approximately 10% more levodopa per day when higher dosages are given (more than 900 mg per day). The dosing interval between doses should be prolonged by 30 to 50% at intervals ranging from 4 to 12 hours. It is recommended to give the smaller dose, if divided doses are not equal, at the end of the day. The dose needs to be titrated further depending on clinical response, as indicated below under 'Titration'. Dosages that provide up to 30% more levodopa per day may be necessary. A guide for substitution of Levodopa Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet treatment for conventional levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combinations is shown in the table below:\r Guideline for conversion from conventional Levodopa/Carbidopa tablet to Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet:\r Conventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 300-400 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 400 mg. Dosage Regimen: 1 tablet 2x daily.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 500-600 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 600 mg. Dosage Regimen: 1 tablet 3x daily.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 700-800 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 800 mg. Dosage Regimen: 4 tablets in 3 or 4 divided doses.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 900-1000 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1000 mg. Dosage Regimen: 5 tablets in 3 or more divided doses.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1100-1200 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1200 mg. Dosage Regimen: 6 tablets in 3 or more divided doses.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1300-1400 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1400 mg. Dosage Regimen: 7 tablets in 3 or more divided doses.\rConventional tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1500-1600 mg\rControlled Release tablet: Daily Dosage of Levodopa 1600 mg. Dosage Regimen: 8 tablets in 3 or more divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rPatients currently treated with levodopa alone: Levodopa must be discontinued at least eight hours before therapy with this CR tablet is started. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial recommended dose is one tablet of this CR tablet twice daily.\r Patients not receiving levodopa: In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial recommended dose is one tablet of this CR tablet twice daily. Initial dosages should not exceed 600 mg per day of levodopa, nor be given at intervals of less than six hours.\r Titration: Following initiation of therapy, doses and dosing intervals may be increased or decreased, depending upon therapeutic response. Most patients have been adequately treated with two to eight tablets per day of this CR tablet administered as divided doses at intervals ranging from four to twelve hours during the waking day. Higher doses (up to 12 tablets) and shorter intervals (less than four hours) have been used, but are not usually recommended. When doses of this CR tablet are given at intervals of less than four hours, or if the divided doses are not equal, it is recommended that the smaller doses be given at the end of the day. In some patients the onset of effect of the first morning dose may be delayed for up to one hour compared with the response usually obtained from the first morning dose of conventional levodopa-carbidopa tablet. An interval of at least three days between dosage adjustments is recommended.\r Maintenance: Because Parkinson’s disease is progressive, periodic clinical evaluations are recommended and adjustment of the dosage regimen of this CR tablet may be required.\r Addition of other antiparkinson medication: Anticholinergic agents, dopamine agonists and amantadine can be given with this CR tablet. Dosage adjustment of this CR tablet may be necessary when these agents are added to an existing treatment regimen for this CR tablet.\r Interruption of therapy: Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of this CR tablet is required, especially if the patient is receiving antipsychotics.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet.\r Antihypertensive agents: Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combinations were added to the treatment of patients receiving some antihypertensive drugs. Therefore when therapy with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required.\r Antidepressants: There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa-levodopa preparations.\r Anticholinergics: Anticholinergics may affect the absorption and thus the patient’s response.\r Iron: Studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of carbidopa and/or levodopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate.\r Other drugs: Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones and risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. The beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson’s disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should be observed carefully for loss of therapeutic response. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone. Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet. The effect of simultaneous administration of antacids with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet on the bioavailability of levodopa has not been studied.\rContraindications\rLevodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should not be given when administration of a sympathomimetic amine is contraindicated. Non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are contraindicated for use with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged release tablet. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged release tablet. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged release tablet may be administered concomitantly with the manufacturer's recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor with selectivity for MAO type B (e.g. selegiline hydrochloride). Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged release tablet is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of this medication, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Because levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged release tablet should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\rSide Effects\rThe side-effect reported most frequently was dyskinesia (a form of abnormal involuntary movements). A greater incidence of dyskinesias was seen with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet than with Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. Other side-effects: nausea, hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, chorea, dry mouth, dream abnormalities, dystonia, insomnia, depression, asthenia, vomiting, anorexia, chest pain, palpitation, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal pain, dark saliva, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, weight loss, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agitation, anxiety, decreased mental acuity, paraesthesia, disorientation, fatigue, headache, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, falling, gait abnormalities, muscle cramps, on-off phenomenon, increased libido, psychotic episodes, dyspnoea, flushing, alopecia, rash, dark sweat, blurred vision, dark urine, cardiac irregularities, hypertension, phlebitis, bitter taste, sialorrhoea, dysphagia, bruxism, hiccups, gastro-intestinal bleeding, flatulence, burning sensation of tongue, development of duodenal ulcer, leucopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are insufficient data to evaluate the possible harmfulness of this substance when used in human pregnancy. It is not known whether carbidopa is excreted in human milk. In a study of one nursing mother with Parkinson's disease, excretion of levodopa in breast milk was reported. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should not be given during pregnancy and to nursing mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen patients are receiving levodopa monotherapy, levodopa must be discontinued at least eight hours before therapy with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is started (at least 12 hours if slow-release levodopa has been administered). Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with levodopa alone because carbidopa permits more levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is not recommended for the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions or for the treatment of Huntingdon’s chorea. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet the onset of effect in patients with early morning dyskinesias may be slower than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. The incidence of dyskinesias is slightly higher during treatment with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet (16.5% vs 12.2%) in advanced patients with motor fluctuations. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or with a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions. Care should be exercised in administering Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet to patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered. \r As with levodopa, Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause involuntary movements and mental disturbances. Patients with a history of severe involuntary movements or psychotic episodes when treated with levodopa alone or levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combination should be observed carefully when Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is substituted. These reactions are thought to be due to increased brain dopamine following administration of levodopa and use of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause recurrence. Dosage reduction may be required. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Impulse control disorders: Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa including Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Children: Safety and effectiveness of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rAntiparkinson drugs\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nIdiopathic Parkinson's disease, in particular to reduce off-period in patients who previously have been treated with levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitors, or with levodopa alone and who have experienced motor fluctuations.\r\nDescription\r\nLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain.

Other side-effects: nausea, hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, chorea, dry mouth, dream abnormalities, dystonia, insomnia, depression, asthenia, vomiting, anorexia, chest pain, palpitation, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal pain, dark saliva, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, weight loss, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agitation, anxiety, decreased mental acuity, paraesthesia, disorientation, fatigue, headache, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, falling, gait abnormalities, muscle cramps, on-off phenomenon, increased libido, psychotic episodes, dyspnoea, flushing, alopecia, rash, dark sweat, blurred vision, dark urine, cardiac irregularities, hypertension, phlebitis, bitter taste, sialorrhoea, dysphagia, bruxism, hiccups, gastro-intestinal bleeding, flatulence, burning sensation of tongue, development of duodenal ulcer, leucopenia, haemolytic and non-haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are insufficient data to evaluate the possible harmfulness of this substance when used in human pregnancy. It is not known whether carbidopa is excreted in human milk. In a study of one nursing mother with Parkinson's disease, excretion of levodopa in breast milk was reported. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should not be given during pregnancy and to nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen patients are receiving levodopa monotherapy, levodopa must be discontinued at least eight hours before therapy with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is started (at least 12 hours if slow-release levodopa has been administered). Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with levodopa alone because carbidopa permits more levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is not recommended for the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions or for the treatment of Huntingdon’s chorea. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet the onset of effect in patients with early morning dyskinesias may be slower than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. The incidence of dyskinesias is slightly higher during treatment with Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet than with conventional Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet (16.5% vs 12.2%) in advanced patients with motor fluctuations. Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or with a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions. Care should be exercised in administering Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet to patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines. Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered. \r\n \nAs with levodopa, Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause involuntary movements and mental disturbances. Patients with a history of severe involuntary movements or psychotic episodes when treated with levodopa alone or levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor combination should be observed carefully when Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet is substituted. These reactions are thought to be due to increased brain dopamine following administration of levodopa and use of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet may cause recurrence. Dosage reduction may be required. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Impulse control disorders: Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa including Levodopa-Carbidopa tablet. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms develop.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Children: Safety and effectiveness of Levodopa-Carbidopa prolonged-release tablet in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 is not recommended.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAntiparkinson drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rThis tablet is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and syndrome. It is useful in relieving many of the symptoms of parkinsonism, particularly rigidity and bradykinesia. This tablet is frequently helpful in the management of tremor, dysphagia, sialorrhea and postural instability associated with Parkinson's disease and syndrome. Levodopa plus carbidopa before physiotherapy increases motor recovery after stroke.\rDescription\rLevodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor which reduces the peripheral metabolism of Levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more Levodopa becomes available to the brain.\rDosage & Administration\rIf 100/10 mg tablet is used: Dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. Titration upward may be required in some patients to achieve optimum dosage of carbidopa. The dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (two tablets q.d.s.) is reached.\r For patients starting with 250/25 mg tablet: The initial dose is one half taken once or twice daily. However, this may not provide the optimal amount of Carbidopa needed by many patients. If necessary, add one-half every day or every other day until optimal response is reached. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of Levodopa a day is one tablet of 250/25 mg three or four times a day.\r Maintenance dose: Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. When more levodopa is requried, 250/25 mg tablet should be substituted at a dosage of one tablet three or four times a day. If necessary, the dosage of 250/25 mg tablet may be increased by half to one tablet every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with a total daily dosage greater than 200 mg Carbidopa is limited.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rSymptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when Carbidopa-Levodopa is added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive medicines. Therefore, when therapy with CarbidopaLevodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive medicine may be required. There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and Carbidopa-Levodopa. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of Carbidopa and/or Levodopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate. Dopamine-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones and risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of Levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of Levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these medicines with Carbidopa-Levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and Carbidopa-Levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to Carbidopa-Levodopa alone.\rContraindications\rCarbidopa-Levodopa tablet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Carbidopa and Levodopa, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Since Levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, Carbidopa-Levodopa should not be used in patients with suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions or a history of melanoma.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects that occur frequently in patients receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa are those due to the central neuropharmacologic activity of dopamine. These reactions usually can be diminished by dosage reduction.

Therefore, use of CarbidopaLevodopa in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the medicine be weighed against possible hazards should pregnancy occur. It is not known whether Carbidopa is excreted in human milk. Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions.

Because many medicines are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of Carbidopa-Levodopa, taking into account the importance of the medicine to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCarbidopa-Levodopa is not recommended for the treatment of medicine-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Carbidopa Levodopa may be given to patients already taking Levodopa alone; however, the Levodopa must be discontinued at least 12 hours before Carbidopa-Levodopa started. Dyskinesias may occur in patients previously treated with Levodopa alone because Carbidopa permits more Levodopa to reach the brain and, thus, more dopamine to be formed. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. Carbidopa-Levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease, or a history of peptic ulcer disease or of convulsions.\r\n \nCare should be exercised to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have atriai, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmia. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage administration and titration. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with Carbidopa-Levodopa, provided the intraocular pressure is weli controlled and the patient monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Carbidopa-Levodopa in infants and children have not been established, and its use in patients below the age of 18 years is not recommended.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAntiparkinson drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rSizopin is indicated in-\rSchizophrenia in patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, conventional antipsychotic drugs.\rPsychosis in Parkinson's disease.\rPharmacology\rClozapine is classified as an 'atypical' antipsychotic drug because of its profile of binding to dopamine receptors and its effects on various dopamine-mediated behaviors differ from those exhibited by other typical antipsychotic drug products. In particular, although Clozapine does interfere with the binding of dopamine at D1, D2, D3 and D5 receptors, and has a high affinity for the D4 receptor. This evidence, consistent with the view that Clozapine is preferentially more active at limbic than at striatal dopamine receptors. This may explain the relative freedom of Clozapine from extrapyramidal side effects. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors.\rDosage & Administration\rSchizophrenia: Adult over 16 years, 12.5 mg once or twice (elderly 12.5 mg once) on first day then 25-50 mg (elderly 25-37.5 mg) on second day then increased gradually (if well tolerated) in steps of 25-50 mg daily (elderly max. increment 25 mg daily) over 14-21 days up to 300 mg daily in divided doses (larger dose at night, up to 200 mg daily may be taken as a single dose at bedtime); if necessary may be further increased in steps of 50-100 mg once (preferably) or twice weekly; usual dose 200-450 mg daily (max. 900 mg daily)\r Psychosis in Parkinson's disease: Adult over 16 years, 12.5 mg at bedtime then increased according to response in steps of 12.5 mg up to twice weekly; usual dose range 25-37.5 mg at bedtime, usual maximum 50 mg daily; exceptionally, dose may be increased further in steps of 12.5 mg weekly to maximum 100 mg daily in 1-2 divided doses.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMyelosuppression may be aggravated with concomitant use of myelosuppressants. Sizopin may interact with other CNS active drugs or alcohol. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with benzodiazepine usage or other psychotropics. Since Sizopin is highly bound to proteins. It may be displaced by other drugs, which are also highly protein bound. Conversely, Sizopin may also displace protein bound drugs (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). Cimetidine may decrease plasma Sizopin levels.\r Although concomitant administration of Carbamazepine and Sizopin is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant Carbamazepine may result in an increase in plasma Sizopin levels. A reduced Sizopin dosage should be used when it is combined with drugs like fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline. The action of hypotensive drugs may be potentiated. Other anticholinergic drug action may also be increased. Administration of adrenaline should generally be avoided due to possibility of reversal of adrenaline effect due to alpha adrenergic blockade by Sizopin. Concomitant use of Sizopin with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (such as phenothiazines, antidepressants, propafenone, flecainide and encainide) or those that inhibit this enzyme such as quinidine; require lower doses of either Sizopin or the other drugs.\rContraindications\rSevere cardiac disorders (e.g. myocarditis); renal impairment (avoid if creatinine clearance less than 10 ml/minute); history of neutropenia or agranulocytosis; bone-marrow disorders; paralytic ileus; alcoholic and toxic psychoses; history of circulatory collapse; drug intoxication; coma or severe CNS depression; uncontrolled epilepsy; breast-feeding.\rSide Effects\rCommon side effects are constipation, dizziness or lightheadedness (mild), drowsiness, headache (mild), increased watering of mouth, nausea or vomiting, unusual weight gain. Less common side effects include abdominal discomfort or heartburn, dryness of mouth.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate studies of Clozapine in pregnant women. Studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Clozapine can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is necessary. Animal studies suggest that Clozapine is secreted in breast milk. Therefore, women taking Clozapine should not nurse their infants.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMedication should not be stopped abruptly; should be tapered off over 1-2 weeks. If conditions warrant abrupt discontinuation (leukopenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy), monitor patient for psychosis and cholinergic rebound (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse effects  (including agranulocytosis, cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and tardive dyskinesia). Significant risk of agranulocytosis, potentially life-threatening. WBC testing should occur weekly for the first 6 months of therapy; thereafter, if acceptable WBC counts are maintained (WBC 3000/mm3, ANC 1500/mm3) then WBC counts can be monitored every other week. WBCs must be monitored weekly for the first 4 weeks after therapy discontinuation. Use with caution in patients receiving other marrow suppressive agents. Eosinophilia has been reported to occur with Sizopin and may require temporary or permanent interruption of therapy.\r Cognitive and/or motor impairment (sedation) is common with Sizopin, resulting in impaired performance of tasks requiring alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). Use with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures, head trauma, brain damage, alcoholism, or concurrent therapy with medications which may lower seizure threshold. Has been associated with benign, self-limiting fever (<100.4°F, usually within first 3 weeks). However, dozapine may also be associated with severe febrile reactions, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Sizopin's potential for extrapyramidal symptoms appear to be extremely low.\r May cause anticholinergic effects; should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention, benign prostatic hyperplasia, narrow-angle glaucoma, xerostomia, visual problems, constipation, or history of bowel obstruction. May cause hyperglycemia; in some cases may be extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death. Use with caution in patients with diabetes or other disorders of glucose regulation; monitor for worsening of glucose control. Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease or impairment; hepatitis has been reported as a consequence of therapy.\r May cause orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia; should be used with caution in patients at risk of hypotension or in patients where transient hypotensive episodes would be poorly tolerated (cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease). Concurrent use of psychotropics and benzodiazepines may increase the risk of severe cardiopulmonary reactions.\r Myocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, and CHF have also been associated with Sizopin. Fatalities due to myocarditis have been reported; highest risk in the first month of therapy, however, later cases also reported. Myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who present with signs/symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema), chest pain, palpitations, new electrocardiographic abnormalities (arrhythmias, ST-T wave abnormalities), or unexplained fever. Patients with tachycardia during the first month of therapy should be closely monitored for other signs of myocarditis. Discontinue Sizopin if myocarditis is suspected; do not rechallenge in patients with Sizopin-related myocarditis. The reported rate of cardiomyopathy in Sizopin treated patients is similar to that in the general population. The majority of patients were over 50 years of age and were taking Sizopin for >6 months. Sizopin should be discontinued in patients with confirmed cardiomyopathy unless benefit clearly outweighs risk. Rare cases of thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and stroke resulting in fatalities, have been associated with Sizopin.\rOverdose Effects\rThe most commonly reported signs and symptoms associated with Sizopin overdose are: altered states of consciousness, including drowsiness, delirium and coma; tachycardia; hypotension; respiratory depression or failure; hypersalivation. Aspiration pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported. Seizures have occurred in a minority of reported cases. Fatal overdoses have been reported with Sizopin, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 gm.\r Management of Overdose: Should be established and maintained an airway; should be ensured adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Activated charcoal, which may be used with sorbitol, may be as or more effective than emesis or lavage, and should be considered in treating overdosage. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring is recommended along with general symptomatic and supportive measures. Additional surveillance should be continued for several days because of the risk of delayed effects. Avoid epinephrine and derivatives when treating hypotension, and quinidine and procainamide when treating cardiac arrhythmia. There are no specific antidotes for Sizopin. Forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. ln managing overdosage, the physician should consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement.\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical neuroleptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30°C.

Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and serotonergic receptors.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSchizophrenia: Adult over 16 years, 12.5 mg once or twice (elderly 12.5 mg once) on first day then 25-50 mg (elderly 25-37.5 mg) on second day then increased gradually (if well tolerated) in steps of 25-50 mg daily (elderly max. increment 25 mg daily) over 14-21 days up to 300 mg daily in divided doses (larger dose at night, up to 200 mg daily may be taken as a single dose at bedtime); if necessary may be further increased in steps of 50-100 mg once (preferably) or twice weekly; usual dose 200-450 mg daily (max. 900 mg daily)\r\n \nPsychosis in Parkinson's disease: Adult over 16 years, 12.5 mg at bedtime then increased according to response in steps of 12.5 mg up to twice weekly; usual dose range 25-37.5 mg at bedtime, usual maximum 50 mg daily; exceptionally, dose may be increased further in steps of 12.5 mg weekly to maximum 100 mg daily in 1-2 divided doses.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMyelosuppression may be aggravated with concomitant use of myelosuppressants. Sizopin may interact with other CNS active drugs or alcohol. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with benzodiazepine usage or other psychotropics. Since Sizopin is highly bound to proteins. It may be displaced by other drugs, which are also highly protein bound. Conversely, Sizopin may also displace protein bound drugs (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). Cimetidine may decrease plasma Sizopin levels.\r\n \nAlthough concomitant administration of Carbamazepine and Sizopin is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant Carbamazepine may result in an increase in plasma Sizopin levels. A reduced Sizopin dosage should be used when it is combined with drugs like fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline. The action of hypotensive drugs may be potentiated. Other anticholinergic drug action may also be increased. Administration of adrenaline should generally be avoided due to possibility of reversal of adrenaline effect due to alpha adrenergic blockade by Sizopin. Concomitant use of Sizopin with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (such as phenothiazines, antidepressants, propafenone, flecainide and encainide) or those that inhibit this enzyme such as quinidine; require lower doses of either Sizopin or the other drugs.\r\nContraindications\r\nSevere cardiac disorders (e.g. myocarditis); renal impairment (avoid if creatinine clearance less than 10 ml/minute); history of neutropenia or agranulocytosis; bone-marrow disorders; paralytic ileus; alcoholic and toxic psychoses; history of circulatory collapse; drug intoxication; coma or severe CNS depression; uncontrolled epilepsy; breast-feeding.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon side effects are constipation, dizziness or lightheadedness (mild), drowsiness, headache (mild), increased watering of mouth, nausea or vomiting, unusual weight gain. Less common side effects include abdominal discomfort or heartburn, dryness of mouth.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate studies of Clozapine in pregnant women. Studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Clozapine can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is necessary. Animal studies suggest that Clozapine is secreted in breast milk. Therefore, women taking Clozapine should not nurse their infants.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMedication should not be stopped abruptly; should be tapered off over 1-2 weeks. If conditions warrant abrupt discontinuation (leukopenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy), monitor patient for psychosis and cholinergic rebound (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse effects  (including agranulocytosis, cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and tardive dyskinesia). Significant risk of agranulocytosis, potentially life-threatening. WBC testing should occur weekly for the first 6 months of therapy; thereafter, if acceptable WBC counts are maintained (WBC 3000/mm3, ANC 1500/mm3) then WBC counts can be monitored every other week. WBCs must be monitored weekly for the first 4 weeks after therapy discontinuation. Use with caution in patients receiving other marrow suppressive agents. Eosinophilia has been reported to occur with Sizopin and may require temporary or permanent interruption of therapy.\r\n \nCognitive and/or motor impairment (sedation) is common with Sizopin, resulting in impaired performance of tasks requiring alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). Use with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures, head trauma, brain damage, alcoholism, or concurrent therapy with medications which may lower seizure threshold. Has been associated with benign, self-limiting fever (<100.4°F, usually within first 3 weeks). However, dozapine may also be associated with severe febrile reactions, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Sizopin's potential for extrapyramidal symptoms appear to be extremely low.\r\n \nMay cause anticholinergic effects; should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention, benign prostatic hyperplasia, narrow-angle glaucoma, xerostomia, visual problems, constipation, or history of bowel obstruction. May cause hyperglycemia; in some cases may be extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death. Use with caution in patients with diabetes or other disorders of glucose regulation; monitor for worsening of glucose control. Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease or impairment; hepatitis has been reported as a consequence of therapy.\r\n \nMay cause orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia; should be used with caution in patients at risk of hypotension or in patients where transient hypotensive episodes would be poorly tolerated (cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease). Concurrent use of psychotropics and benzodiazepines may increase the risk of severe cardiopulmonary reactions.\r\n \nMyocarditis, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, and CHF have also been associated with Sizopin. Fatalities due to myocarditis have been reported; highest risk in the first month of therapy, however, later cases also reported. Myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who present with signs/symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, peripheral edema), chest pain, palpitations, new electrocardiographic abnormalities (arrhythmias, ST-T wave abnormalities), or unexplained fever. Patients with tachycardia during the first month of therapy should be closely monitored for other signs of myocarditis. Discontinue Sizopin if myocarditis is suspected; do not rechallenge in patients with Sizopin-related myocarditis. The reported rate of cardiomyopathy in Sizopin treated patients is similar to that in the general population. The majority of patients were over 50 years of age and were taking Sizopin for >6 months. Sizopin should be discontinued in patients with confirmed cardiomyopathy unless benefit clearly outweighs risk. Rare cases of thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and stroke resulting in fatalities, have been associated with Sizopin.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe most commonly reported signs and symptoms associated with Sizopin overdose are: altered states of consciousness, including drowsiness, delirium and coma; tachycardia; hypotension; respiratory depression or failure; hypersalivation. Aspiration pneumonia and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported. Seizures have occurred in a minority of reported cases. Fatal overdoses have been reported with Sizopin, generally at doses above 2500 mg. There have also been reports of patients recovering from overdoses well in excess of 4 gm.\r\n \nManagement of Overdose: Should be established and maintained an airway; should be ensured adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Activated charcoal, which may be used with sorbitol, may be as or more effective than emesis or lavage, and should be considered in treating overdosage. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring is recommended along with general symptomatic and supportive measures. Additional surveillance should be continued for several days because of the risk of delayed effects. Avoid epinephrine and derivatives when treating hypotension, and quinidine and procainamide when treating cardiac arrhythmia. There are no specific antidotes for Sizopin. Forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. ln managing overdosage, the physician should consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAtypical neuroleptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30°C. Keep away from light and out of the reach of children.\r\n",

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Gabarol is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Gabarol should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Gabarol should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Gabarol, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Gabarol when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Gabarol may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Gabarol is rapidly discontinued. Gabarol should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Gabarol may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Gabarol and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Gabarol extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Gabarol, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route.

        "description": "Indications\rSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\rPharmacology\rRivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues.\rDosage\rRivastigmine capsule-\rInitial dose: Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day.\rDose titration: The starting dose is Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to Rivastigmine 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.\rMaintenance dose: The effective dose is 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a day. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \rRe-initiation of therapy: If treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.\rRivastigmine transdermal patch: Apply patch on intact skin for a 24-hour period; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.\rInitial Dose: Initiate treatment with 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine transdermal patch.\rDose Titration: After a minimum of 4 weeks, if tolerated, increase dose to 9.5 mg/24 hours, which is the minimum effective dose. Following a minimum additional 4 weeks, may increase dosage to maximum dosage of 13.3 mg/24 hours.\rMild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5 mg/24 hours or 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rSevere Alzheimer’s Disease: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rFor treatment interruption longer than 3 days, retitrate dosage starting at 4.6 mg per 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, Rivamer may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. In view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and Rivamer.\rContraindications\rThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or other carbamate derivatives.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor Rivastigmine no clinical data are available. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. In animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects, resp diseases. Cholinergic stimulation may increase gastric acid secretion. May exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Pregnancy. Renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor body wt. Asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. May worsen extrapyramidal symptoms. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in moderate renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed\r Use in children: Rivamer is not recommended for use in children.\rOverdose Effects\rMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms have occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to the known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may also occur. Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is not recommended.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for Dementia\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia.

        "description": "Indications\rSymptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\rPharmacology\rRivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues.\rDosage\rRivastigmine capsule-\rInitial dose: Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day.\rDose titration: The starting dose is Rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to Rivastigmine 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.\rMaintenance dose: The effective dose is 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a day. Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. \rRe-initiation of therapy: If treatment is interrupted for more than several days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.\rRivastigmine transdermal patch: Apply patch on intact skin for a 24-hour period; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.\rInitial Dose: Initiate treatment with 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine transdermal patch.\rDose Titration: After a minimum of 4 weeks, if tolerated, increase dose to 9.5 mg/24 hours, which is the minimum effective dose. Following a minimum additional 4 weeks, may increase dosage to maximum dosage of 13.3 mg/24 hours.\rMild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 9.5 mg/24 hours or 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rSevere Alzheimer’s Disease: Rivastigmine transdermal patch 13.3 mg/24 hours once daily.\rFor treatment interruption longer than 3 days, retitrate dosage starting at 4.6 mg per 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAs a cholinesterase inhibitor, Rivamer may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. In view of its pharmacodynamic effects, rivastigmine should not be given concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances and might interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medicinal products. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and Rivamer.\rContraindications\rThe use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or other carbamate derivatives.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor Rivastigmine no clinical data are available. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. In animals, rivastigmine is excreted into milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects, resp diseases. Cholinergic stimulation may increase gastric acid secretion. May exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Pregnancy. Renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor body wt. Asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. May worsen extrapyramidal symptoms. Lactation.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in moderate renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability should be closely followed\r Use in children: Rivamer is not recommended for use in children.\rOverdose Effects\rMost cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment. Where symptoms have occurred, they have included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, hypertension or hallucinations. Due to the known vagotonic effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on heart rate, bradycardia and/or syncope may also occur. Ingestion of 46 mg occurred in one case; following conservative management the patient fully recovered within 24 hours. As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response.

        "description": "Indications\rQutipin SR is indicated for the treatment of Acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder including: treatment of manic episodes satisfying DSM-IV criteria for mania associated with bipolar  disorder, treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, in combination with a mood stabilizer, for the prevention of recurrence of manic, depressive or mixed episodes.\rPharmacology\rQuetiapine Fumarate is an atypical psychotropic agent belonging to a chemical class, the dibenzothiazepine derivatives. Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1, and adrenergic α1 and α2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). From Day 4 onwards, the dose should be titrated to the usual effective dose range of 300-450 mg/day. However, this may be adjusted, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient, within the range 150 to 750 mg/day.\r Manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 100 mg (Day 1), 200 mg (Day 2), 300 mg (Day 3) and 400 mg (Day 4). Further dosage adjustments up to 800mg/day by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mg/day. The dose may be adjusted depending on clinical response & tolerability of the individual patient, within the range of 200 to 800 mg/day. The usual effective dose is in the range of 400 to 800mg/day.\r Depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered once daily at bedtime, with or without food. The usual dose is 300 mg/day. The daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). Quetiapine can be titrated to 400 mg on Day 5 and up to 600mg by Day 8. Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine at 300mg and 600 mg, however no additional benefit was seen in the 600mg group during short term treatment.\r Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in combination with mood stabilizers: Patients who have responded to Quetiapine in combination therapy with a mood stabiliser for acute treatment of bipolar disorder should continue on Quetiapine therapy at the same dose. Quetiapine dose can be re-adjusted depending on clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. Efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine (administered twice daily totalling 400mg to 800mg a day) as combination therapy with a mood stabilizer.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised when Qutipin SR is used concomitantly with medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or to increase QT interval. Co-administration of Qutipin SR and thioridazine or carbamazepine caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin SR. Co-administration of Qutipin SR with another microsomal enzyme inducer, phenytoin, also caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin SR.\rContraindications\rQuetiapine is contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to it.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with Qutipin SR are somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, withdrawal (discontinuation) symptoms, elevations in serum triglyceride levels, elevations in total cholesterol (predominantly LDL cholesterol), decreases in HDL cholesterol, weight gain, decreased haemoglobin and extrapyramidal symptoms.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety and efficacy of Quetiapine during human pregnancy have not been established. Therefore, Quetiapine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits justify the potential risks and the administered dose and duration of treatment should be as low and as short as possible. The degree to which Quetiapine is excreted into human milk is unknown. Women who are breast-feeding should therefore be advised to avoid breast-feeding while taking Quetiapine.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening: Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. \rConcomitant Illness: Qutipin SR should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other conditions predisposing to hypotension. Qutipin SR may induce orthostatic hypotension especially during the initial dose-titration period. \rSeizures: As with other antipsychotics, caution is recommended when treating patients with a history of seizures.\rTardive Dyskinesia and Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, dose reduction or discontinuation of Qutipin SR should be considered.\rNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: This syndrome has been associated with antipsychotic treatment. Qutipin SR should be discontinued and appropriate medical treatment given.\rQT Prolongation: As with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when Qutipin SR is prescribed in patients with cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation.\rNeutropenia: Severe neutropenia (<0.5x109/L) has been uncommonly reported in Qutipin SR clinical trials. Most cases of severe neutropenia have occurred within the first two months of starting therapy with Qutipin SR.\rHyperglycemia & diabetes mellitus: Increases in blood glucose and hyperglycaemia, and occasional reports of diabetes, have been observed in clinical trials with Qutipin SR.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: As with other antipsychotics, Qutipin SR should be used with caution in the elderly, especially during the initial dosing period. The rate of dose titration may need to be slower, and the daily therapeutic dose lower, than that used in younger patients, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. The mean plasma clearance of Qutipin SR was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly subjects when compared with younger patients.\r Children and Adolescents: Qutipin SR is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of Qutipin SR. There is no specific antidote to Qutipin SR. In cases of severe intoxication, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered, and intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. In cases of Qutipin SR overdose, refractory hypotension should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (adrenaline and dopamine should be avoided, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of Qutipin SR-induced alpha blockade). Close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers.\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical neuroleptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister pack and the carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.

        "description": "Indications\rQutipin SR is indicated for the treatment of Acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder including: treatment of manic episodes satisfying DSM-IV criteria for mania associated with bipolar  disorder, treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, in combination with a mood stabilizer, for the prevention of recurrence of manic, depressive or mixed episodes.\rPharmacology\rQuetiapine Fumarate is an atypical psychotropic agent belonging to a chemical class, the dibenzothiazepine derivatives. Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1, and adrenergic α1 and α2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). From Day 4 onwards, the dose should be titrated to the usual effective dose range of 300-450 mg/day. However, this may be adjusted, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient, within the range 150 to 750 mg/day.\r Manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 100 mg (Day 1), 200 mg (Day 2), 300 mg (Day 3) and 400 mg (Day 4). Further dosage adjustments up to 800mg/day by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mg/day. The dose may be adjusted depending on clinical response & tolerability of the individual patient, within the range of 200 to 800 mg/day. The usual effective dose is in the range of 400 to 800mg/day.\r Depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered once daily at bedtime, with or without food. The usual dose is 300 mg/day. The daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). Quetiapine can be titrated to 400 mg on Day 5 and up to 600mg by Day 8. Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine at 300mg and 600 mg, however no additional benefit was seen in the 600mg group during short term treatment.\r Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in combination with mood stabilizers: Patients who have responded to Quetiapine in combination therapy with a mood stabiliser for acute treatment of bipolar disorder should continue on Quetiapine therapy at the same dose. Quetiapine dose can be re-adjusted depending on clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. Efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine (administered twice daily totalling 400mg to 800mg a day) as combination therapy with a mood stabilizer.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised when Qutipin SR is used concomitantly with medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or to increase QT interval. Co-administration of Qutipin SR and thioridazine or carbamazepine caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin SR. Co-administration of Qutipin SR with another microsomal enzyme inducer, phenytoin, also caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin SR.\rContraindications\rQuetiapine is contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to it.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with Qutipin SR are somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, withdrawal (discontinuation) symptoms, elevations in serum triglyceride levels, elevations in total cholesterol (predominantly LDL cholesterol), decreases in HDL cholesterol, weight gain, decreased haemoglobin and extrapyramidal symptoms.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety and efficacy of Quetiapine during human pregnancy have not been established. Therefore, Quetiapine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits justify the potential risks and the administered dose and duration of treatment should be as low and as short as possible. The degree to which Quetiapine is excreted into human milk is unknown. Women who are breast-feeding should therefore be advised to avoid breast-feeding while taking Quetiapine.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening: Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. \rConcomitant Illness: Qutipin SR should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other conditions predisposing to hypotension. Qutipin SR may induce orthostatic hypotension especially during the initial dose-titration period. \rSeizures: As with other antipsychotics, caution is recommended when treating patients with a history of seizures.\rTardive Dyskinesia and Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, dose reduction or discontinuation of Qutipin SR should be considered.\rNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: This syndrome has been associated with antipsychotic treatment. Qutipin SR should be discontinued and appropriate medical treatment given.\rQT Prolongation: As with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when Qutipin SR is prescribed in patients with cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation.\rNeutropenia: Severe neutropenia (<0.5x109/L) has been uncommonly reported in Qutipin SR clinical trials. Most cases of severe neutropenia have occurred within the first two months of starting therapy with Qutipin SR.\rHyperglycemia & diabetes mellitus: Increases in blood glucose and hyperglycaemia, and occasional reports of diabetes, have been observed in clinical trials with Qutipin SR.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: As with other antipsychotics, Qutipin SR should be used with caution in the elderly, especially during the initial dosing period. The rate of dose titration may need to be slower, and the daily therapeutic dose lower, than that used in younger patients, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. The mean plasma clearance of Qutipin SR was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly subjects when compared with younger patients.\r Children and Adolescents: Qutipin SR is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of Qutipin SR. There is no specific antidote to Qutipin SR. In cases of severe intoxication, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered, and intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. In cases of Qutipin SR overdose, refractory hypotension should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (adrenaline and dopamine should be avoided, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of Qutipin SR-induced alpha blockade). Close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers.\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical neuroleptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rQutipin is indicated for the treatment of Acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder including: treatment of manic episodes satisfying DSM-IV criteria for mania associated with bipolar  disorder, treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, in combination with a mood stabilizer, for the prevention of recurrence of manic, depressive or mixed episodes.\rPharmacology\rQuetiapine Fumarate is an atypical psychotropic agent belonging to a chemical class, the dibenzothiazepine derivatives. Quetiapine is an antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain: serotonin 5HT1A and 5HT2, dopamine D1 and D2, histamine H1, and adrenergic α1 and α2 receptors. Quetiapine has no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of action of Quetiapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug's efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 antagonism. Quetiapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence and that of adrenergic a receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). From Day 4 onwards, the dose should be titrated to the usual effective dose range of 300-450 mg/day. However, this may be adjusted, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient, within the range 150 to 750 mg/day.\r Manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered twice daily, with or without food. The total daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 100 mg (Day 1), 200 mg (Day 2), 300 mg (Day 3) and 400 mg (Day 4). Further dosage adjustments up to 800mg/day by Day 6 should be in increments of no greater than 200 mg/day. The dose may be adjusted depending on clinical response & tolerability of the individual patient, within the range of 200 to 800 mg/day. The usual effective dose is in the range of 400 to 800mg/day.\r Depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder: Quetiapine should be administered once daily at bedtime, with or without food. The usual dose is 300 mg/day. The daily dose for the first four days of therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3) and 300 mg (Day 4). Quetiapine can be titrated to 400 mg on Day 5 and up to 600mg by Day 8. Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine at 300mg and 600 mg, however no additional benefit was seen in the 600mg group during short term treatment.\r Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in combination with mood stabilizers: Patients who have responded to Quetiapine in combination therapy with a mood stabiliser for acute treatment of bipolar disorder should continue on Quetiapine therapy at the same dose. Quetiapine dose can be re-adjusted depending on clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. Efficacy was demonstrated with Quetiapine (administered twice daily totalling 400mg to 800mg a day) as combination therapy with a mood stabilizer.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCaution should be exercised when Qutipin is used concomitantly with medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or to increase QT interval. Co-administration of Qutipin and thioridazine or carbamazepine caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin. Co-administration of Qutipin with another microsomal enzyme inducer, phenytoin, also caused increases in the clearance of Qutipin.\rContraindications\rQuetiapine is contra-indicated in patients who are hypersensitive to it.\rSide Effects\rThe most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) with Qutipin are somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, withdrawal (discontinuation) symptoms, elevations in serum triglyceride levels, elevations in total cholesterol (predominantly LDL cholesterol), decreases in HDL cholesterol, weight gain, decreased haemoglobin and extrapyramidal symptoms.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safety and efficacy of Quetiapine during human pregnancy have not been established. Therefore, Quetiapine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits justify the potential risks and the administered dose and duration of treatment should be as low and as short as possible. The degree to which Quetiapine is excreted into human milk is unknown. Women who are breast-feeding should therefore be advised to avoid breast-feeding while taking Quetiapine.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSuicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening: Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and suicide (suicide-related events). This risk persists until significant remission occurs. \rConcomitant Illness: Qutipin should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other conditions predisposing to hypotension. Qutipin may induce orthostatic hypotension especially during the initial dose-titration period. \rSeizures: As with other antipsychotics, caution is recommended when treating patients with a history of seizures.\rTardive Dyskinesia and Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, dose reduction or discontinuation of Qutipin should be considered.\rNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: This syndrome has been associated with antipsychotic treatment. Qutipin should be discontinued and appropriate medical treatment given.\rQT Prolongation: As with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when Qutipin is prescribed in patients with cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation.\rNeutropenia: Severe neutropenia (<0.5x109/L) has been uncommonly reported in Qutipin clinical trials. Most cases of severe neutropenia have occurred within the first two months of starting therapy with Qutipin.\rHyperglycemia & diabetes mellitus: Increases in blood glucose and hyperglycaemia, and occasional reports of diabetes, have been observed in clinical trials with Qutipin.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly: As with other antipsychotics, Qutipin should be used with caution in the elderly, especially during the initial dosing period. The rate of dose titration may need to be slower, and the daily therapeutic dose lower, than that used in younger patients, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. The mean plasma clearance of Qutipin was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly subjects when compared with younger patients.\r Children and Adolescents: Qutipin is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rIn clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of Qutipin. There is no specific antidote to Qutipin. In cases of severe intoxication, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered, and intensive care procedures are recommended, including establishing and maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and monitoring and support of the cardiovascular system. In cases of Qutipin overdose, refractory hypotension should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (adrenaline and dopamine should be avoided, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of Qutipin-induced alpha blockade). Close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers.\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical neuroleptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the blister pack and the carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Store in a cool and dry place away from light.\r\nIndications\r\nQutipin is indicated for the treatment of Acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder including: treatment of manic episodes satisfying DSM-IV criteria for mania associated with bipolar  disorder, treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder, maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, in combination with a mood stabilizer, for the prevention of recurrence of manic, depressive or mixed episodes.\r\nPharmacology\r\nQuetiapine Fumarate is an atypical psychotropic agent belonging to a chemical class, the dibenzothiazepine derivatives.

Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren: Oleanz has not been studied in subjects under 18 years of age.\r Elderly patients (age 65 and over): starting dose 5 mg/day\r Patients with hepatic, renal impairment: starting dose 5 mg/day\rTherapeutic Class\rAtypical neuroleptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nOleanz is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and related psychoses where positive symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, hostility and suspiciousness) and/or negative symptoms (e.g. flattened affect, emotional and social withdrawal, poverty of speech) are prominent. Oleanz is indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid cycling course\r\nPharmacology\r\nOlanzapine is an antipsychotic agent and has affinities for serotonin 5HT2A/2C, 5HT3, 5HT6; dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, D5; cholinergic muscarinic receptors M1-M5; α1 adrenergic; and histamine H1 receptors. The mechanism of action of Olanzapine, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this drug’s efficacy in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) antagonism. Olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours. The absorption is not affected by food. Olanzapine is not mutagenic or clastogenic as well as not carcinogenic.\r\nDosage\r\nSchizophrenia, combination therapy for Mania, Bipolar Disorder: The initial dose is 5-10 mg once daily. Daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range of 5-20 mg daily. Dosage greater than 10 mg daily only after reassessment. Maximum dose is 20 mg daily.\r\n \nMonotherapy for Mania: Initially 15 mg once daily. Daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range of 5-20 mg daily. Dosage greater than 15 mg only after reassessment. Maximum dose is 20 mg daily.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nOlanzapine can be given without regard to meals. Gradual tapering of the dose should be considered while discontinuing Olanzapine.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nOleanz may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Drugs that induce CYP1A2 or glucoronyl transferase enzymes e.g, Omeprazole and Rifampicin, may increase Oleanz clearance. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may potentially inhibit Oleanz elimination. Carbamazepine may increase the clearance of Oleanz. Concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of Oleanz by 50-60%. Caution should be taken when Oleanz is administered with centrally acting drugs and alcohol.\r\nContraindications\r\nOlanzapine is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the product as well as in patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nVery common undesirable effects are somnolence and weight gain. Besides increased appetite, elevated glucose levels, elevated triglyceride levels, dizziness, akathisia, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, mild and transient anticholinergic effects including constipation and dry mouth, asthenia, edema and photosensitivity reaction etc. may be observed.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nOlanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the foetus. So, patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Olanzapine. There is no report to show teratogenecity. Patients should not breast feed if they are taking Olanzapine.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nOleanz should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or have conditions associated with seizures. Oleanz should be used cautiously in patients with low leukocyte and/or neutrophil counts for any reason, drug induced bone marrow depression/toxicity caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy, hypereosinophilic conditions, impaired hepatic function, and patients using hepatotoxic medicines, centrally acting drug and medicines know to increase QT interval, especially in the elderly.

        "description": "Indications\rNeugaba is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rAdjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older\rFibromyalgia\rNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\rNeugaba CR tablet is indicated for:\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\rPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN)\rMig - MedEx campaign banner\rPregaba - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rPregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\rDosage\rNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r Management of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r Conversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r Pregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDrug interaction with medication: Neugaba is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\rDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\rContraindications\rPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\rSide Effects\rMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Neugaba should be discontinued immediately in these cases. Neugaba should also be discontinued immediately if hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea and wheezing) occur. Antiepileptic drugs, including Neugaba, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Respiratory depression may occur with Neugaba when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Patients need to be monitored and dosage adjusted as appropriate. Neugaba may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients ability to drive or operate machinery. Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if Neugaba is rapidly discontinued. Neugaba should be withdrawn gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Neugaba may cause peripheral edema. Caution should be exercised when coadministering Neugaba and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children and adolescents: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury and fibromyalgia. In case of adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures, safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of Neugaba extended-release tablet in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose with Neugaba, sign and symptoms are reduced consciousness, depression/anxiety, confusional state, agitation and restlessness. Seizures and heart block have also been reported. There is no specific antidote. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Primary anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30°C), protected from light & moisture.

It does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB or benzodiazepine receptors. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of Pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results in animal studies suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in Pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects.\r\nDosage\r\nNeuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults (DPN): The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Begin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Neugaba is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus. Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAngioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur and may be associated with life threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment.

The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 330 mg once daily.\r\n \nPostherpetic neuralgia in adults (PHN): The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 75 to 150 mg two times a day or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 ml/min. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day).\r\n \nBegin dosing of Pregabalin CR capsule at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate Pregabalin CR capsule, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of Pregabalin CR capsule is 660 mg once daily.\r\n \nManagement of fibromyalgia in adults: The recommended dose of Pregabalin is 300 to 450 mg/day. Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).\r\n \nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury in adults: The recommended dose range of Pregabalin is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate Pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day.\r\n \nConversion from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet: When switching from Pregabalin capsules to Pregabalin CR capsule tablet on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of Pregabalin capsule as prescribed and initiate Pregabalin CR capsule therapy after an evening meal.\r\n \nPregabalin tablet total daily dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily): Pregabalin CR capsule capsule dose (dosed once a day)\r\n75 mg/daily: 82.5 mg/day\r\n150 mg/daily: 165 mg/day\r\n225 mg/daily: 247.5 mg/day\r\n300 mg/daily: 330 mg/day\r\n450 mg/daily: 495 mg/day\r\n600 mg/daily: 660 mg/day\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Pregabalin is taken in oral route. It can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin CR tablet should be administered after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. If patients miss taking their dose of Pregabalin CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of Pregabalin CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of Pregabalin CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal. When discontinuing both Pregabalin and Pregabalin CR, it should be gradually tapered over a minimum of 1 week.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDrug interaction with medication: Neugaba is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions.\r\nDrug interaction with food and others: Not applicable.\r\nContraindications\r\nPregabalin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pregabalin or any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nMost common side effects in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain and thinking abnormal (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention). Most common side effects in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Lonazep in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Lonazep for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLonazep does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Lonazep on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Lonazep are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Lonazep may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Lonazep may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Lonazep. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Lonazep in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Lonazep pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Lonazep might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Lonazep is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r Treatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Lonazep.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\rReconstitution\rSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r Intravenous infusion: Lonazep (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Lonazep. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Lonazep infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r Intramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\rChemical Structure\rMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\rChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\rCommon Questions about Lonazep 2 mg Tablet\rIs Lonazep 2 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\rLonazep 2 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\rCan Lonazep 2 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\rYou need to take Lonazep 2 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r\n \nThere are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral:\r\nAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\r\nThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\r\nPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r\n \nInjection:\r\nInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\r\nAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nLonazep does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Lonazep on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Lonazep are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r\n \nNursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Lonazep may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Lonazep may produce absence status.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r\n \nGeriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r\n \nRenal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Lonazep. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r\n \nHepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Lonazep in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Lonazep pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Lonazep might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Lonazep is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma. Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Lonazep.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Lonazep (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Lonazep. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Lonazep infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Lonazep 2 mg Tablet\r\nIs Lonazep 2 mg Tablet a sleeping pill?\r\nLonazep 2 mg Tablet is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Lonazep 2 mg Tablet be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Lonazep 2 mg Tablet as long as the doctor has advised you.

Coma, if it occurs, usually lasts a few hours but it may be more protracted and cyclical, particularly in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with respiratory disease. Benzodiazepines increase the effects of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol.\r\n \nTreatment: Monitor the patient’s vital signs and institute supportive measures as indicated by the patient’s clinical state. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects. Further absorption should be prevented using an appropriate method e.g. treatment within 1-2 hours with activated charcoal. If activated charcoal is used airway protection is imperative for drowsy patients. In case of mixed ingestion gastric lavage may be considered, however not as a routine measure. If CNS depression is severe consider the use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. This should only be administered under closely monitored conditions. It has a short half-life (about an hour), therefore patients administered flumazenil will require monitoring after its effects have worn off. Flumazenil is to be used with extreme caution in the presence of drugs that reduce seizure threshold (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants). Refer to the prescribing information for flumazenil, for further information on the correct use of Lonazep MD.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs, Benzodiazepine hypnotics\r\nReconstitution\r\nSlow intravenous injection: The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1 ml of water for injection prior to administration so as to avoid local irritation of the veins. The injection solution should be prepared immediately before use. IV injection should be administered slowly with continuous monitoring of EEG, respiration and blood pressure.\r\n \nIntravenous infusion: Lonazep MD (the vial) can be diluted for infusion in a ratio of 1 vial (1 mg) to at least 85 ml diluting media. The diluting media can be any of the following: sodium chloride 0.9%; sodium chloride 0.45% + glucose 2.5%; glucose 5% or glucose 10%. These mixtures are stable for 24 hours at room temperature. Infusion bags other than PVC should be used for infusing Lonazep MD. If PVC infusion bags are used then the mixture should be infused immediately or within 4 hours. The infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Do not prepare Lonazep MD infusions using sodium bicarbonate solution, as precipitation of the solution may occur.\r\n \nIntramuscular injection: The IM route should be used only in exceptional cases or if IV administration is not feasible.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC15H10ClN3O3\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Clonazepam\r\nCommon Questions about Lonazep MD 0.5 mg Tablet\r\nIs Lonazep MD 0.5 mg DT a sleeping pill?\r\nLonazep MD 0.5 mg DT is not used as a sleeping pill as it might cause difficulty in sleeping.\r\nCan Lonazep MD 0.5 mg DT be taken for the longer-term?\r\nYou need to take Lonazep MD 0.5 mg DT as long as the doctor has advised you.

        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks.\r It is also indicated alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. It may be indicated in patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.\r The effectiveness of Lonazep in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Lonazep for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\rPharmacology\rClonazepam exhibits pharmacological properties which are common to benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects. The central actions of benzodiazepines are mediated through an enhancement of the GABAergic neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses. In the presence of benzodiazepines the affinity of the GABA receptor for the neurotransmitter is enhanced through positive allosteric modulation resulting in an increased action of released GABA on the postsynaptic transmembrane chloride ion flux.\r There are also animal data showing an effect of clonazepam on serotonin. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absences seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations as well as irregular spikes and waves. Generalized EEG abnormalities are more regularly suppressed than focal abnormalities. According to these findings clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies.\rDosage & Administration\rOral:\rAdults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\rThe initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg given in two divided dose. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days.\rPediatric Patients: In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses.\r Injection:\rInfants and children: half of a vial (0.5 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion.\rAdults: 1 vial (1 mg) by slow IV injection or by IV infusion. This dose can be repeated as required (1-4 mg are usually sufficient to reverse the status). In adults, the rate of injection must not exceed 0.25 - 0.5 mg per minute (0.5-1.0 ml of the prepared solution) and a total dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLonazep does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital. The effect of Lonazep on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.\rContraindications\rIt should not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, nor in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease. It may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy but is contraindicated in acute narrow angle glaucoma.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequently occurring side effects of Lonazep are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases, these may diminish with time; behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Abnormal eye movements, aphonia, coma, tremor, vertigo, confusion, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, hysteria, increased libido, insomnia, psychosis & palpitations may also occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: From preclinical studies it cannot be excluded that clonazepam possesses the possibility of producing congenital malformations. From epidemiological evaluations there is evidence that anticonvulsant drugs act as teratogens. However, it is difficult to determine from published epidemiological reports which drug or combination of drugs is responsible for defects in the newborn. The possibility also exists that other factors e.g. genetic factors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the foetus. During pregnancy, Clonazepam may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. Administration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the heartbeat of the unborn child and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in the neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the medication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants have occasionally been reported with benzodiazepines.\r Nursing Mothers: Although the active ingredient of Clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers undergoing treatment with this drug should not breastfeed. If there is a compelling indication for Clonazepam, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWhen used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Lonazep may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Lonazep may produce absence status.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric Use: In infants and small children Rivotril may cause increased production of saliva and bronchial secretion. Therefore special attention must be paid to maintaining patency of the airways. \r Geriatric Use: Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug–receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms and organ function.\r Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Lonazep. Based on pharmacokinetic criteria, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.\r Hepatic Impairment: Plasma protein binding of Lonazep in cirrhotic patients is significantly different from that in healthy subjects (free fraction 17.1±1.0% vs 13.9±0.2%). Although the influence of hepatic impairment on Lonazep pharmacokinetics has not been further investigated, experience with another closely related nitrobenzodiazepine (nitrazepam) indicates that clearance of unbound Lonazep might be reduced in liver cirrhosis.\rOverdose Effects\rSymptoms: Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Overdose of Lonazep is seldom life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnoea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression and coma.

The mechanism by which Sodium Valproate exerts its anti-epileptic effects has not been established. However, it has been suggested that its activity is related to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\rDosage & Administration\rOral: Sodium Valproate tablets may be given once or twice daily and syrup should be given in divided doses.\r Epilepsy:\rAdult: Initially, 600 mg daily is given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day intervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily (20-30 mg/kg daily).\rChildren (over 20 kg)- Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (usually in the range of 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily.\rChildren (up to 20 kg)- Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses.\rFebrile convulsion: 20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.\r Bipolar disorder: Initially 600 mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day) in 2-3 divided doses.

Drugs to which it interacts most significantly are Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Warfarin, Aspirin etc.\rContraindications\rSodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Use of Sodium Valproate is restricted during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential.\rSide Effects\rThe most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Encorate Chrono Vaiproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Encorate Chrono.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSodium Vaiproate crosses the placenta and in humans, exposure to valproate in the first trimester has been associated with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida in newborn. Pregnant women treated with Sodium Vaiproate should be offered to estimate serum a-fetoprotein. Sodium Valproate is excreted in breast miik. However, breast-feeding by a mother taking Sodium Valproate probably causes no risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLiver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Encorate Chrono is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided.

The dose can be subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID).\r\n \nEpilepsy:\r\nPatients over 12 years of age: the effective dose of Gabapentin is 900 to 1800 mg/day given in three divided doses. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day.\r\nPaediatric patients age 3-12 year: the starting dose should range from 10-15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately three days.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nGabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAntacids may reduce the bioavailability of Gabatin by up to 20 %. Cimetidine may alter its reanal excretion. Gabatin does not interact with other anti-epileptic drug or with oral contraceptive preparations.\r\nContraindications\r\nGabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug.\r\nSide Effects\r\nFatigue, Dizziness, ataxia, weight gain, peripheral edema, dry mouth and somnolence may occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category C. it should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefits justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Gabapentin may be secreted through the breast milk. So it should be used during lactation only if potential benefits justifies the potential risk to the baby.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients should be instructed to take Gabatin only as prescribed. While using Gabatin patients should be instructed either not to drive a car or to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experiences about Gabatin whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn case of renal impaired patients Gabatin doses must be reduced.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore below 25°C temperature.

        "description": "Indications\rRasagil tablet is indicated as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD).\rPharmacology\rRasagiline is an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and is used as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases. The way it acts is related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose is 1 mg orally once daily as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy in patients not taking levodopa. In patients taking levodopa, with or without other PD drugs (e.g., dopamine agonist, amantadine, anticholinergics), the recommended initial dose of Rasagiline is 0.5 mg once daily. If the patient tolerates the daily 0.5 mg dose, but a sufficient clinical response is not achieved, the dose may be increased to 1 mg once daily. When Rasagiline is used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the levodopa dose may be considered, based upon individual response. The recommended dose of Rasagiline should not be exceeded because of risk of hypertension.\r Pediatric use: The safety & effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r Geriatric use: There were no significant differences in the safety profile of the geriatric & nongeriatric patients.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rRasagiline is contraindicated for use with meperidine, tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs), including other selective MAO-B inhibitors, because of risk of serotonin syndrome.\rSide Effects\rSide effects include joint pain, mild headache, depressed mood, dizziness, spinning sensation, hair loss, mild skin rash, numbness or tingly feeling, dry mouth, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain or upset, vomiting, weight loss etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. Experimental data indicated that Rasagiline inhibits prolactin secretion and, thus, may inhibit lactation. It is not known whether Rasagiline is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Rasagiline is administered to a breastfeeding mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypertension: Exacerbation of hypertension may occur during treatment with Rasagil. Medication adjustment may be necessary if elevation of blood pressure is sustained. Dietary tyramine restriction is not required during treatment with recommended doses of Rasagil. However, certain foods that may contain very high amounts (more than 150 mg) of tyramine that could potentially cause severe hypertension because of tyramine interaction in patients taking Rasagil, even at the recommended doses, due to increased sensitivity to tyramine. In that case, patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine.\r Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome has been reported with concomitant use of an antidepressant (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic & tetracyclic antidepressants, Triazolopyridine antidepressants) and a nonselective MAOI (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine) or selective MAO-B inhibitors, such as Rasagil.\r Ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors should not exceed a dose of Rasagil 0.5 mg once daily.\r Hepatic impairment: Patients with mild hepatic impairment should be given the dose of Rasagil 0.5 mg once daily. Rasagil should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\r The concomitant use of Rasagil and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided. At least five weeks should\relapse between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of treatment with Rasagil. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of Rasagil and initiation of treatment with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine.\r The concomitant use of Rasagil and dextromethorphan or sympathomimetics such as, those present in nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal product containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine is not recommended.\r During the clinical development program the occurrence of cases of melanoma prompted the consideration of a possible association with Rasagil. The data collected suggests that Parkinson's disease and not any medicinal products in particular, is associated with a higher risk of skin cancer (not exclusively melanoma). Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rSigns and symptoms of Rasagil overdose may include drowsiness, dizziness, faintness, irritability, hyperactivity, agitation, severe headache, hallucinations, trismus, opisthotonos, convulsions and coma; rapid and irregular pulse, hypertension, hypotension and vascular collapse; precordial pain, respiratory depression and failure, hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, and cool, clammy skin.\r Treatment: There is no specific antidote for Rasagil overdose. The following suggestions are offered: Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilator assistance, as required. Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of hyperpyrexia may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte imbalance is essential. For this reason, in cases of overdose with Rasagil, dietary tyramine restriction should be observed for several weeks to reduce the risk of hypertensive tyramine reaction.

        "description": "Indications\rEpilepsy: Topmate is indicated as monotherapy in adults and children aged 6 years and above with newly diagnosed epilepsy who have generalised tonic-clonic seizures or partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures. Topmate is indicated as adjunctive therapy for adults and children over 2 years of age who are inadequately controlled on conventional first line antiepileptic drugs for partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures; seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures.\r Migraine: Topmate is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine headache. Prophylactic treatment of migraine may be considered in situations such as: adults experiencing three or more migraine attacks per month; frequent migraine attacks that significantly interfere with the patient's daily routine. Continuing therapy should be reviewed every six months.\rPharmacology\rA seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.\r The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.\r Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.\rDosage & Administration\rEpilepsy: Monotherapy:\rAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1 week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 25 or 59 mg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy is 100 mg/day and the maximum recommended daily dose is 400 mg.\rChildren aged 6-16 years: Treatment of children aged 6 years and above should begin at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose range for topiramate monotherapy in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy aged 6 years and above is 3 to 6 mg/kg/day. Higher doses have been tolerated and rarely doses up to 16 mg/kg/day have been given.\rEpilepsy: Adjunctive therapy:\rAdults and children over 16 years: The minimal effective dose as adjunctive therapy is 200 mg per day. The usual total daily dose is 200 mg to 400 mg in two divided doses. Some patients may require doses up to 800 mg per day, which is the maximum recommended dose.\rChildren aged 2-16 years: The recommended total daily dose of Topiramate as adjunctive therapy is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. Daily doses up to 30 mg/kg/day have been studied and were generally well tolerated.\rMigraine:\rAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1-week. The dosage should then be increased in increments of 25 mg/day administered at 1-week intervals. The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for the prophylaxis of migraine headache is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses. Some patients may experience a benefit at a total daily dose of 50 mg/day.\rChildren: Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis has not been studied in children under 16 years.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThe addition of Topmate to other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic add, phenobarbitai, primidone) has no clinically significant effect on their steady-state plasma concentrations, except in some patients where the addition of Topmate to phenytoin may result in an increase of plasma concentrations of phenytoin.\r CNS Depressants: Topmate should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.\r Oral Contraceptives: In an interaction study with a combined oral contraceptive, Topmate increased plasma clearance of the oestrogenic component significantly. Consequently, and bearing in mind the potential risk of teratogenicity, patients should receive a preparation containing not less than 50 μg of oestrogen or use some alternative non-hormonal method of contraception. Patients taking oral contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns.\r Lithium: In patients with bipolar disorder, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with Topmate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure (26% for AUC) following Topmate doses of up to 600 mg/day. Lithium levels should be monitored when co-administered with Topmate.\r Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ): The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of Topmate. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after Topmate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and Topmate were administered in combination.\r Metformin: Topmate did not affect metformin tmax. The clinical significance of the effect of Topmate on metformin pharmacokinetics is unclear. Oral plasma clearance of Topmate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on Topmate pharmacokinetics is unclear. When Topmate is added or withdrawn in patients on metformin therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Pioglitazone: When Topmate is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to Topmate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Glibenclamide: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of Topmate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glibenclamide. When Topmate is added to glibenclamide therapy or glibenclamide is added to Topmate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r Others: Topmate, when used concomitantly with other agents predisposing to nephrolithiasis, may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis. While using Topmate, agents like these should be avoided since they may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of renal stone formation. The interaction with benzodiazepines has not been studied. \r Valproic Acid: Concomitant administration of Topmate and valproic acid has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. An association of hyperammonemia with Topmate monotherapy or concomitant treatment with other anti epileptics has not been established.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rNausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, taste disturbance, weight loss, anorexia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, speech disorder, drowsiness, insomnia, impaired memory & concentration, anxiety, depression, visual disturbance, lesscommonly: sucidal ideation, rarely: reduced sweetening mainly children, metabolic acidosis and alopecia, very rarely: Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and serious skin reaction.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTopiramate should not be used during pregnancy unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Topiramate should not be used during breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including Topmate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency. Topmate can produce central nervous system-related adverse events and may be more sedative than other antiepileptic drugs. Drowsiness is a likelihood. In addition, there have been reports of visual disturbances/blurred vision. Patients should be warned of these and advised that if affected, they should not drive, operate machinery and/or take part in activities where such reactions could put themselves or others at risk.\rOverdose Effects\rTopmate overdose can result in severe metabolic acidosis. In acute Topmate overdose, if the ingestion is recent, the stomach should be emptied immediately by lavage or by induction of emesis. Activated charcoal has been shown to adsorb Topmate in vitro. Treatment should be appropriately supportive. Haemodialysis has been shown to be an effective means of removing Topmate from the body. The patient should be well hydrated.\rTherapeutic Class\rAdjunct anti-epileptic drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nEpilepsy: Topmate is indicated as monotherapy in adults and children aged 6 years and above with newly diagnosed epilepsy who have generalised tonic-clonic seizures or partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures. Topmate is indicated as adjunctive therapy for adults and children over 2 years of age who are inadequately controlled on conventional first line antiepileptic drugs for partial seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures; seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures.\r\n \nMigraine: Topmate is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine headache. Prophylactic treatment of migraine may be considered in situations such as: adults experiencing three or more migraine attacks per month; frequent migraine attacks that significantly interfere with the patient's daily routine. Continuing therapy should be reviewed every six months.\r\nPharmacology\r\nA seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to a transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.\r\n \nThe exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized. Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.\r\n \nTopiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines. Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity. Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nEpilepsy: Monotherapy:\r\nAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1 week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 25 or 59 mg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy is 100 mg/day and the maximum recommended daily dose is 400 mg.\r\nChildren aged 6-16 years: Treatment of children aged 6 years and above should begin at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial target dose range for topiramate monotherapy in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy aged 6 years and above is 3 to 6 mg/kg/day. Higher doses have been tolerated and rarely doses up to 16 mg/kg/day have been given.\r\nEpilepsy: Adjunctive therapy:\r\nAdults and children over 16 years: The minimal effective dose as adjunctive therapy is 200 mg per day. The usual total daily dose is 200 mg to 400 mg in two divided doses. Some patients may require doses up to 800 mg per day, which is the maximum recommended dose.\r\nChildren aged 2-16 years: The recommended total daily dose of Topiramate as adjunctive therapy is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. Daily doses up to 30 mg/kg/day have been studied and were generally well tolerated.\r\nMigraine:\r\nAdults and children over 16 years: Titration should begin at 25 mg nightly for 1-week. The dosage should then be increased in increments of 25 mg/day administered at 1-week intervals. The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for the prophylaxis of migraine headache is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses. Some patients may experience a benefit at a total daily dose of 50 mg/day.\r\nChildren: Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis has not been studied in children under 16 years.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nThe addition of Topmate to other antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic add, phenobarbitai, primidone) has no clinically significant effect on their steady-state plasma concentrations, except in some patients where the addition of Topmate to phenytoin may result in an increase of plasma concentrations of phenytoin.\r\n \nCNS Depressants: Topmate should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.\r\n \nOral Contraceptives: In an interaction study with a combined oral contraceptive, Topmate increased plasma clearance of the oestrogenic component significantly. Consequently, and bearing in mind the potential risk of teratogenicity, patients should receive a preparation containing not less than 50 μg of oestrogen or use some alternative non-hormonal method of contraception. Patients taking oral contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns.\r\n \nLithium: In patients with bipolar disorder, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with Topmate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure (26% for AUC) following Topmate doses of up to 600 mg/day. Lithium levels should be monitored when co-administered with Topmate.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ): The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of Topmate. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after Topmate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and Topmate were administered in combination.\r\n \nMetformin: Topmate did not affect metformin tmax. The clinical significance of the effect of Topmate on metformin pharmacokinetics is unclear. Oral plasma clearance of Topmate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on Topmate pharmacokinetics is unclear. When Topmate is added or withdrawn in patients on metformin therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r\n \nPioglitazone: When Topmate is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to Topmate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r\n \nGlibenclamide: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of Topmate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glibenclamide. When Topmate is added to glibenclamide therapy or glibenclamide is added to Topmate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.\r\n \nOthers: Topmate, when used concomitantly with other agents predisposing to nephrolithiasis, may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis. While using Topmate, agents like these should be avoided since they may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of renal stone formation. The interaction with benzodiazepines has not been studied. \r\n \nValproic Acid: Concomitant administration of Topmate and valproic acid has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. An association of hyperammonemia with Topmate monotherapy or concomitant treatment with other anti epileptics has not been established.\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nNausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, dry mouth, taste disturbance, weight loss, anorexia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, speech disorder, drowsiness, insomnia, impaired memory & concentration, anxiety, depression, visual disturbance, lesscommonly: sucidal ideation, rarely: reduced sweetening mainly children, metabolic acidosis and alopecia, very rarely: Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and serious skin reaction.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nTopiramate should not be used during pregnancy unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Topiramate should not be used during breastfeeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIn patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including Topmate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency.

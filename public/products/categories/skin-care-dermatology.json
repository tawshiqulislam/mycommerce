Application should be careful and only on depigmented skin. Application to the edges or parts of the skin that are normally pigmented will cause the skin to darken, as if it were sunburned.\r The effectiveness of VitiLSi is further increased by short-term, daily exposure to solar radiation at a time when solar radiation is safe, for example 10 minutes every 10 hours.

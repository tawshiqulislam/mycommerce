        "description": "Indications\rNovelon Lite is indicated for:\rAs an oral contraceptive\rTreatment of moderate acne vulgaris\rTreatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)\rPharmacology\rThis contains two active ingredients- Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic version of estrogen and Drospirenone is a synthetic form of progesterone. The hormonal components of this preparation inhibit ovulation by suppressing gonadotropin release. Secondary mechanisms, which may contribute to the effectiveness of this tablet as a contraceptive, include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm penetration) and changes in the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).\r Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen-related sodium retention. In combination with Ethinyloestradiol, Drospirenone displays a favorable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinyloestradiol-related sex hormone-binding globulin increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens.\rDosage\rTo achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness tablets must be taken in the order directed on the package every day at about the same time. Tablet-taking should be started with the first pink tablet of the upper row & have to continue daily for 24 consecutive days. After completion of pink tablet, white tablet should be taken from 25th day to 28th day. Withdrawal bleeding usually starts on days 2-3 after starting the white tablets & don't stop taking white tablets though your menstruation is already started. Each subsequent new pack is started on the day after the last white tablet of the previous pack.\r No preceding hormonal contraceptive use in the past month: Tablet taking has to start on day 1 of the woman’s menstrual cycle. The woman should be instructed to take the first light pink active tablet from the upper row of this tablet according to the direction and in this case no additional methods of contraception are required. Starting on days 2-5 is allowed, but during the first cycle a barrier method is recommended in addition for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.\r Changing from another combined hormonal pill or vaginal ring or transdermal patch: In case of combined hormonal pill, woman should start with the first light pink tablet of upper row on the day after the last active tablet of her previous COC. In case of a vaginal ring or transdermal patch has been used, the woman should start using this tablet preferably on the day of removal.\r Changing from a progestogen-only-method (minipill, injection, implant) or from a progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (IUS): The woman may switch any day from the minipill (or from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, from an injectable when the next injection would be due), but should in all of these cases be advised to additionally use a barrier method (like-condom) for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.\r Following first-trimester abortion: The woman may start immediately and in this case no need to take additional contraceptive method.\r Following delivery or second-trimester abortion: Women are advised to start at day 21 to 28 after delivery or second-trimester abortion. When starting later, the woman are advised to additionally use a barrier method (like-condom) for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rManagement of Missed Tablets: Missed white pills from the last row of the blister are placebo tablets and thus can be disregarded. But if you forgot to take a light pink tablet one day, take the missed tablet as soon as you remember. This may mean taking two tablets the very next day. Additionally you should use some other method of contraception (like a condom) until next 7 days. If you forget to take the tablets for two continuous days, then it is likely that you will no longer be protected against pregnancy. You should therefore discontinue taking the tablet and adopt some other temporary methods (condom/foam tablet) till your next menstruation. Discard the unfinished pack of tablets and start taking tablets from the light pink tablet of the top row of a fresh pack from the first day of next menstruation.\r If you have missed a period after taking tablet: If you have taken all of your pills at the right time and you have not vomited or used other medicines then you are very unlikely to be pregnant. Continue to take tablet as usual. If you miss your period twice in a row, you may be pregnant. Tell your doctor immediately. Do not start the next pack of this tablet until your doctor has checked you are not pregnant.\r How to Delay a Period: To delay period women should continue with another new pack of this tablet just after finishing the light pink active tablet of the present pack (that is no need to take white placebo tablet of present pack). The extension can be carried on for as long as wished until the end of light pink color tablet of the second pack. When women wish their period to begin, just stop tablet taking. While using the second pack woman may have some breakthrough bleeding or spotting. Start with your next pack after the usual 4 day white inactive tablet interval.\r Advice in case of Vomiting: If vomiting occurs within 3-4 hours after light pink tablet taking, absorption may not be complete. In such an event, the advice concerning management of missed tablets is applicable. The woman must take the extra active tablet (light pink color) needed from a back up pack after vomiting.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rInteractions between ethinylestradiol and other drugs may lead to decreased or increased ethinylestradiol concentrations, respectively. Decreased ethinylestradiol serum concentrations may cause an increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities and may possibly reduce efficacy of the oral contraceptive. Example of substances that may decrease serum ethinylestradiol concentrations include rifampicin, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, dexamethasone, griseofulvin, topiramate, some protease inhibitors, modafinil, ritonavir and barbiturates. Certain antibiotics including ampicillin, other penicillins and tetracyclines may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. During concomitant use of this tablet & other drugs that may lead to decreased ethinylestradiol serum concentrations, it is recommended that a non hormonal back-up method of contraception to be used in addition to the regular intake of this tablet.\rContraindications\rThis tablet should not be used:\rKnown or suspected pregnancy\rIf you have heart disease, clotting of blood in the vein\rIf you suffer from liver disease or jaundice\rIf you suffer from high blood pressure, migraine, feel something hard in your breast, diabetes with vascular involvement, experience excessive bleeding for which no reason has yet been ascertained\rThe presence or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolic events (e.g. deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or of a cerebrovascular accident)\rHistory of migraine with focal neurological symptoms\rPancreatitis or a history thereof if associated with severe hypertriglyceridaemia\rSevere renal insufficiency or acute renal failure\rPresence or history of liver tumours (benign or malignant)\rUndiagnosed vagina! bleeding\rHypersensitivity to any of the components of this preparation.\rSide Effects\rDifferent types of tablet suit to different types of woman. At the initial stage some women may experience side-effects like dizziness, headache, breast pain, nausea or unscheduled uterine bleeding. These symptoms may occur in >3% of users. After starting one brand of oral contraceptive tablets, if you feel any inconvenience such as migraine, changes in eyesight or speech, unusual pain or swelling in your legs, sharp chest pains or shortness of breath, rash, yellow skin or a rise in blood pressure take immediate advice from your doctor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse during pregnancy: This is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancy must be excluded before starting this tablet. If pregnancy occurs during use of this tablet, the preparation must be withdrawn immediately. Women who discontinue oral contraceptives with the intent of becoming pregnant, a non-hormonal method of contraception is recommended for three months before attempting to conceive.\r Use during lactation: Lactation may be influenced by combined pill as they may reduce the quantity and change the composition of breast milk, therefore the use of estrogen containing combined pill should generally not be recommended until the nursing mother has completely weaned her child. Small amounts of the contraceptive steroids and/or their metabolites may be excreted with the milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIf any circulatory disorder (like- myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular injury etc) or other risk factors(like smoking, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, migraine, atrial fibrillation etc) are present, the benefits of COC use should be weighed against the possible risks for each individual woman and discussed with the woman before she decides to start using it.

        "description": "Indications\rEmergency contraception is a rescue method that is aimed to prevent fertilization in case of unprotected intercourse.\r This contraception must be used as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours and no later than 72 hours (3 days) after the unprotected sexual intercourse, particularly;\rif you have had sexual intercourse whereas either yourself or your partner did not use a contraceptive method;\rif you have forgotten to take consecutive 3 contraceptive pills;\rif your partner's condom has broken, slipped, or been improperly removed, or if he has forgotten to use it;\rif you fear that your intrauterine device has been expelled;\rif your vaginal diaphragm or your contraceptive cap has moved or if you have removed it too early;\rif you are afraid that the method of coitus interruptus has failed or if you have had sexual intercourse during the period when you are supposed to be fertile while using the rhythm method;\rin the event of rape.\rComposition\r1.5 mg: Each tablet contains 1.5 mg levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel belongs to a group of medicines called progestogen. Each pack contains 1 round white tablet.\r0.75 mg: Each tablet contains 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel belongs to a group of medicines called progestogen. Each pack contains 2 round white tablets.\rDescription\rEmcon 1 is an emergency contraceptive for women. This should be used within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. It should not be taken as a regular birth control pill. This medicine is also known as Post Coital Pill and Morning After Pill. The active substance in this medicine is Emcon 1.\r Some information about the menstrual cycle and contraception:\r The menstrual cycle is the time elapsed between two menstrual periods. Normally, the cycle lasts for 28 days but its length can vary noticeably from one woman to another.\r Menstrual periods occur when a woman is not pregnant. At the middle of the cycle, an ovum is expelled by one of the 2 ovaries (this moment is called \"ovulation\"). Usually, ovulation takes place in the middle of the cycle, but it can occur at any moment during the cycle.\r If sperms are near the ovum, fertilization (i.e. the merge between the ovum and a sperm cell in order to create an embryo) can take place. After a few days, the fertilized ovum implants in the womb and the pregnancy starts.\r Contraceptive methods are aimed to prevent:\reither the ovulation: this is the case for the contraceptive pill,\reither the fertilization (merge of the sperm with the ovum): this is the case for condoms,\ror the implantation of a fertilized ovum: this is the case for intrauterine devices.\rEmergency contraception aims to block ovulation or prevent implantation if the sexual intercourse has taken place in the hours or days preceding ovulation, i.e. at a time when the likelihood of fertilization is the highest. It could also prevent implantation. It becomes inefficient as soon as implantation has started.\r Without a contraceptive method, a woman cannot exclude the possibility of becoming pregnant after sexual intercourse.\r If you have taken this medicine and that you do not use regular contraception, it is highly recommended to visit your doctor in order to obtain advice on a method of contraception suitable to you.\r The advice in case of risk of transmission of sexually transmitted disease:\r If you fear a pregnancy, this can mean that you have not used a condom (or that you have used it improperly) during sexual intercourse. You may therefore have contracted a sexually transmitted disease or the AIDS virus, if you are not aware of your partner's health status, or if you have several partners. You should ask for advice from your doctor as soon as possible for early detection and, if necessary, early treatment. During your next sexual intercourse, it is recommended to take the appropriate measures in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy and/or a sexually transmitted disease and to avoid AIDS contamination. If you need further information about Emcon 1, ask your doctor, or a family planning center.\rPharmacology\rOral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.\rDosage\r1.5 mg Tablet: The treatment necessitates the intake of one tablet. The Levonorgestrel tablet must be taken as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours, after the unprotected intercourse, and no longer than within 72 hours (3 days) after the intercourse. Levonorgestrel can be taken at any moment during the menstrual cycle.\r 0.75 mg Tablet: The first Levonorgestrel tablet must be taken within 72 hours of the intercourse and the second tablet should be taken after 12 hours of the intake of the first tablet. Levonorgestrel must be taken within 48 hours of unprotected intercourse and in no way after 72 hours because the effectiveness of the medicine starts reducing after 48 hours of intercourse. Levonorgestrel can be taken at any moment during the menstrual cycle.\r After using emergency contraception, it is recommended to use a local contraceptive mean (condom, spermicide, and cervical cap) until the next menstrual period resumes. The use of Levonorgestrel does not contraindicate the continuation of regular hormonal contraception. If you have used this medicine while you were using oral contraception (contraceptive pill), you should carry on taking the usual tablets until the end of the treatment. In case no menstrual period occurs in the next pill-free period following the use of Levonorgestrel a pregnancy test should be performed to rule out a pregnancy.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rOral use. The tablet should be taken with a glass of water.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rInteractions with other medicines and other forms of interaction: Simultaneous administration of certain anticonvulsant agents (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine), also other medications such as rifampicin, and griseofulvin can reduce or suppress the effectiveness of this emergency contraception.\rContraindications\rIf you have hypersensitivity to levonorgestrel or any of the excipients of Levonorgestrel.\rSide Effects\rUndesirable effects which have been observed are:\rNausea and vomiting\rDizziness, fatigue, headache\rAbdominal pain\rA feeling of breast tenderness\rBleeding can occur after taking this medicine\rInform the doctor of any unwanted effect which is not mentioned here.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThis medicine is not indicated in case of pre-existing pregnancy and cannot interrupt it. In case of failure of this contraceptive mean persisting pregnancy, epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of progestogen on the malformation of a fetus. Lactation is possible. However, since levonorgestrel is secreted into breast milk, it is suggested that you breastfeed immediately before taking each Levonorgestrel tablet and that you skip the nursing following each Levonorgestrel administration.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEmergency contraception must be used exceptionally, since:\rIt does not allow to prevent a pregnancy in every instance:\rThe associated hormonal overdosing is not advisable in the case of regular intake.\rIt cannot replace regular contraception.\rAfter taking Emcon 1, the menstrual period usually occurs at the expected date nevertheless, it can occur earlier or later by a few days. After taking this medicine, it is therefore mandatory to check the absence of pregnancy by performing a pregnancy test in case of abnormal bleeding at the date of excepted menses or in case of menstrual delay of more than 5 days.\r The use of emergency contraception does not replace the necessary precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and the measures to be taken in case of risk of transmission.\r Taking this medicine is not recommended if you have had an ectopic pregnancy or if you have had salpingitis or if you have a severe digestive disease that impairs the absorption of medications.\r If vomiting would occur within three hours after taking this medicine, it is recommended to take immediately another Emcon 1 tablet.\rOverdose Effects\rNo acute toxicity has been demonstrated with this medicine in the case of intake of several doses. The efficacy of this medicine is not guaranteed if the dose has been omitted.\rTherapeutic Class\rEmergency Contraceptive Pill, Oral Contraceptive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not exceed the expiry date printed on the outer packaging.

After a few days, the fertilized ovum implants in the womb and the pregnancy starts.\r\n \nContraceptive methods are aimed to prevent:\r\neither the ovulation: this is the case for the contraceptive pill,\r\neither the fertilization (merge of the sperm with the ovum): this is the case for condoms,\r\nor the implantation of a fertilized ovum: this is the case for intrauterine devices.\r\nEmergency contraception aims to block ovulation or prevent implantation if the sexual intercourse has taken place in the hours or days preceding ovulation, i.e. at a time when the likelihood of fertilization is the highest. It could also prevent implantation. It becomes inefficient as soon as implantation has started.\r\n \nWithout a contraceptive method, a woman cannot exclude the possibility of becoming pregnant after sexual intercourse.\r\n \nIf you have taken this medicine and that you do not use regular contraception, it is highly recommended to visit your doctor in order to obtain advice on a method of contraception suitable to you.\r\n \nThe advice in case of risk of transmission of sexually transmitted disease:\r\n \nIf you fear a pregnancy, this can mean that you have not used a condom (or that you have used it improperly) during sexual intercourse. You may therefore have contracted a sexually transmitted disease or the AIDS virus, if you are not aware of your partner's health status, or if you have several partners. You should ask for advice from your doctor as soon as possible for early detection and, if necessary, early treatment. During your next sexual intercourse, it is recommended to take the appropriate measures in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy and/or a sexually transmitted disease and to avoid AIDS contamination. If you need further information about Emcon 1, ask your doctor, or a family planning center.\r\nPharmacology\r\nOral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.\r\nDosage\r\n1.5 mg Tablet: The treatment necessitates the intake of one tablet. The Levonorgestrel tablet must be taken as soon as possible, preferably within 12 hours, after the unprotected intercourse, and no longer than within 72 hours (3 days) after the intercourse. Levonorgestrel can be taken at any moment during the menstrual cycle.\r\n \n0.75 mg Tablet: The first Levonorgestrel tablet must be taken within 72 hours of the intercourse and the second tablet should be taken after 12 hours of the intake of the first tablet. Levonorgestrel must be taken within 48 hours of unprotected intercourse and in no way after 72 hours because the effectiveness of the medicine starts reducing after 48 hours of intercourse. Levonorgestrel can be taken at any moment during the menstrual cycle.\r\n \nAfter using emergency contraception, it is recommended to use a local contraceptive mean (condom, spermicide, and cervical cap) until the next menstrual period resumes. The use of Levonorgestrel does not contraindicate the continuation of regular hormonal contraception. If you have used this medicine while you were using oral contraception (contraceptive pill), you should carry on taking the usual tablets until the end of the treatment. In case no menstrual period occurs in the next pill-free period following the use of Levonorgestrel a pregnancy test should be performed to rule out a pregnancy.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nOral use. The tablet should be taken with a glass of water.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nInteractions with other medicines and other forms of interaction: Simultaneous administration of certain anticonvulsant agents (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine), also other medications such as rifampicin, and griseofulvin can reduce or suppress the effectiveness of this emergency contraception.\r\nContraindications\r\nIf you have hypersensitivity to levonorgestrel or any of the excipients of Levonorgestrel.\r\nSide Effects\r\nUndesirable effects which have been observed are:\r\nNausea and vomiting\r\nDizziness, fatigue, headache\r\nAbdominal pain\r\nA feeling of breast tenderness\r\nBleeding can occur after taking this medicine\r\nInform the doctor of any unwanted effect which is not mentioned here.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis medicine is not indicated in case of pre-existing pregnancy and cannot interrupt it. In case of failure of this contraceptive mean persisting pregnancy, epidemiological studies indicate no adverse effects of progestogen on the malformation of a fetus. Lactation is possible. However, since levonorgestrel is secreted into breast milk, it is suggested that you breastfeed immediately before taking each Levonorgestrel tablet and that you skip the nursing following each Levonorgestrel administration.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nEmergency contraception must be used exceptionally, since:\r\nIt does not allow to prevent a pregnancy in every instance:\r\nThe associated hormonal overdosing is not advisable in the case of regular intake.\r\nIt cannot replace regular contraception.\r\nAfter taking Emcon 1, the menstrual period usually occurs at the expected date nevertheless, it can occur earlier or later by a few days. After taking this medicine, it is therefore mandatory to check the absence of pregnancy by performing a pregnancy test in case of abnormal bleeding at the date of excepted menses or in case of menstrual delay of more than 5 days.\r\n \nThe use of emergency contraception does not replace the necessary precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and the measures to be taken in case of risk of transmission.\r\n \nTaking this medicine is not recommended if you have had an ectopic pregnancy or if you have had salpingitis or if you have a severe digestive disease that impairs the absorption of medications.\r\n \nIf vomiting would occur within three hours after taking this medicine, it is recommended to take immediately another Emcon 1 tablet.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNo acute toxicity has been demonstrated with this medicine in the case of intake of several doses. The efficacy of this medicine is not guaranteed if the dose has been omitted.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nEmergency Contraceptive Pill, Oral Contraceptive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not exceed the expiry date printed on the outer packaging. Keep the tablet in the outer carton. Keep the medicine away from children. Store in cool dry conditions (below 30° C).",

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in oral contraception.\rPharmacology\rThis is a combined oral contraceptive tablet containing the synthetic progestogen, drospirenone and the synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol. The contraceptive effect of this tablet is based on the interaction of various factors, the most important of which are seen as the inhibition of ovulation and the changes in cervical secretion. When this tablet is taken according to instructions, the egg cells are prevented from maturing to the point at which they can be fertilized, the cervical mucus remains thick so as to constitute a barrier to sperm and the endometrium is rendered unreceptive to implantation. As well as protection against pregnancy, estrogen/progestogen combinations have several positive properties which, next to the negative properties, can be useful in deciding on the method of birth control. The cycle is more regular and the menstruation is often less painful and bleeding is lighter.\r Drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, counteracting estrogen related sodium retention. In combination with ethinylestradiol, drospirenone displays a favourable lipid profile with an increase in high-density lipoprotein HDL. Drospirenone exerts antiandrogenic activity and does not counteract the ethinylestradiol-related sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) increase which is useful for binding and inactivating the endogenous androgens. Drospirenone is devoid of any androgenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid and antiglucocorticoid activity. This in combination with the antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic properties, gives drospirenone a biochemical and pharmacological profile closely resembling the natural hormone progesterone.\rDosage\rWhen and how to take the tablets: The this tablet pack contains 21 tablets. On the pack, each tablet is marked with the day of the week on which it is to be taken. Take your tablet at about the same time each day, with some water if necessary. Follow the direction of the arrows until all 21 tablets have been taken. During the next 7 days don't take any tablet. A period should begin during these 7 days (the withdrawal bleed), unusually it will start on day 2-3 after the last this tablettablet. Start taking your next pack on the 8th day even if your period continues. This means that you will always start new packs on the same day of the week and also that you have your withdrawal bleed on about the same days each month.\r Starting your first pack of this tablet: When no hormonal contraceptive has been used in the past month. Start taking this tablet on the first day of your cycle, i.e. the first day of menstrual bleeding. Take a tablet marked with that day of the week. For example, if your period starts on a Sunday, take a tablet marked Sunday. Then follow thedaysin order. You may also start on days 2-5 of your cycle, but in that case make sure you also use an additional contraceptive method (barrier method) for the first 7 days of tablet-taking in the first cycle.\r When changing form another combined Pill: You can start taking this tablet the day after you have the last tablet from your present Pill pack (this means no tablet-free break). If your present Pill pack also contains inactive tablets you can start this tablet on the day after taking the first active tablet (if you are not sure which this is, ask your doctor or pharmacist). You can also start later, but never later than the day following the tablet free break of your present Pill (or the day after the last inactive tablet of your present Pill).\r When changing from progestogen-only Pill (Mini Pill): You can stop taking the mini pill any day and start taking this tablet the next day, at the same time. But make sure you also use an additional-contraceptive method (a barrier method) for the first 7 days of tablet-taking when having intercourse.\r When changing from an Injectable or Implant: Start using this tablet when your next injection is due or on the day that your implant is removed. But make sure you also use an additional contraceptive method (a barrier method) for the first 7 days of tablet-taking when having intercourse.\r After having a baby: If you have just had a baby, your doctor may tell you to wait until after your first normal period before you start taking this tablet. Sometimes it is possible to start sooner. Your doctor will advise you. If you are breast-feeding and want to take this tablet you should discuss this first with your doctor.\r After a miscarriage or an abortion: Your doctor will advise you.\r If too many this tablet tablets are taken (overdose): There have been no reports of serious harmful effects from taking too many this tablet tablets at one time. If you have taken several tablets at a time, you may have nausea, vomiting or vaginal bleeding. If you discover that a child has taken this tablet ask your doctor for advice.\r When you want to stop taking this tablet: You can stop taking this tablet at any time you want. If you do not want to become pregnant, ask your doctor about other methods of birth control. If you stop taking this tablet because you want to get pregnant, it is generally recommended that you wait until you have had a natural period before trying to conceive.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rIf you forget to take tablets\rIf you are less than 12 hours late in taking a tablet, the reliability of the Pill is maintained. Take the tablet as soon as you remember and take the next tablets at the usual times.\rIf you are more than 12 hours late in taking any tablet, the reliability of the Pill may be reduced. The more consecutive tablets you have missed, the higher the risk that the contraceptive efficacy is decreased. There is a particularly high risk of becoming pregnant if you miss tablets at the beginning or at the end of the pack. Therefore, you should follow the rules given below.\rMore than one tablet forgotten in a pack: Ask your doctor for advice.\r1 tablet missed in week 1: Take the missed tablet as soon as your remember (even if this means taking two tablets at the same time) and take the next tablets at the usual time. Use extra contraceptive precautions (barrier method) for the next 7 days. If you had sexual intercourse in the week before missing the tablets, there is a possibility of becoming pregnant. So tell your doctor immediately.\r1 tablet missed in week 2: Take the missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two tablets at the same time) and take the next tablets at the usual time. The reliability of the Pill is maintained. You need not use extra contraceptive precautions.\r1 tablet missed in week 3: You may choose either of the following options, without the need for extra contraceptive precautions.\rTake the missed tablet as soon as you remember (even if this means taking two tablets at the same time) and take the next tablets at the usual time. Start the next pack as soon as the current pack is finished so that no gap is left between packs. You may not have a withdrawal bleed until the end of the second pack but you may have spotting or breakthrough bleeding on tablet-taking days. Or\r Stop taking tablets from your current pack, have a tablet-free break of 7 days or less (also count the day you missed your tablet) and continue with the next pack. When, following this method, you can always start your next pack on the same day of the week as you usually do.\r If you have forgotten tablets in a pack and you do not have the expected period in the first normal tablet-free break, you may be pregnant. Consult your doctor before you start with the next pack.\r you vomit: If you vomit within 3 to 4 hours after taking your this tablet tablet, the active ingredients may not have been completely absorbed. This is like missing a tablet. Therefore, follow the advice for missed tablets.\r you want to delay your period: you can delay your period if you start with your next pack of this tablet immediately after finishing your current pack. You can continue with this pack for as long as you wish, until this pack is empty. When you wish your period to begin, just stop tablet taking. While using the second pack you may have some breakthrough bleeding or spotting on tablet-taking days. Start with your next pack after the usual 7 days tablet free break.\r you want to change the starting day of your period: If you take your tablets as directed, you will have your period on about the same day every 4 weeks. If you want to change this, just shorten, (never lengthen) the next tablet- free break. For example, if your period usually starts on a Friday and in future you want it to start on Tuesday (3 days earlier) you should now start your next pack 3 days sooner than you usually do. If you make your tablet-free break very short (e.g. 3 days or less) you may not have bleeding during the break. You may have some breakthrough bleeding or spotting during the use of the next pack.\r you have unexpected bleeding: With all Pills, for the first few months, you can have irregular vaginal bleeding (spotting or breakthrough bleeding) between your periods. You may need to use sanitary protection, but continue to take your tablets as normal. Irregular vaginal bleeding usually stops once your body has adjusted to the Pill (usually after about 3 tablet-taking cycles). If it continues, becomes heavy or starts again, tell your doctor.\r you have missed a period: If you have taken all of your tablets at the right time and you have not vomited or used other medicines then you are very unlikely to be pregnant. Continue to take this tablet as usual.\r If you miss your period twice in row, you may be pregnant. Tell your doctor immediately. Do not start the next pack of this tablet until your doctor has checked you are not pregnant.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rPreparations containing estrogen/progestogen combinations should not be used in the presence of any of the conditions listed below.

        "description": "Indications\rPeuli is indicated for emergency contraception within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure.\rDescription\rPeuli 30 mg tablet is an Emergency Contraceptive (EC) pill that prevents unwanted pregnancy. This is a Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulator (SPRM). Peuli tablet is supplied for oral administration. The inactive ingredients are lactose monohydrate, povidone K-30, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate.\rPharmacology\rUlipristal Acetate is an orally-active synthetic SPRM that acts via high-affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. The primary mechanism of action is inhibition or delay of ovulation. Data shows that even when taken immediately before ovulation is scheduled to occur, Ulipristal Acetate is able to postpone follicular rupture in some women.\rDosage & Administration\rOne 30 mg tablet must be taken as soon as possible but no later than 120 hours of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, with or without food. If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of intake, then another tablet needed to be taken. Ulipristal Acetate can be taken at any time of menstrual cycle.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPeuli interacts with the following drugs: Barbiturates, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Rifampicin, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole etc.\rContraindications\rUlipristal Acetate is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to active substances and in pregnancy.\rSide Effects\rMost common side-effects are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, fatigue, dizziness, breast tenderness etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rContraindicated in suspected or existing pregnancy. Ulipristal Acetate excretes in breast milk. So breastfeeding is not recommended for one week after intake. Extremely limited data are available on the health of the fetus/newborn exposed to Ulipristal acetate.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rExisting Pregnancy: Peuli is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy.\r Ectopic Pregnancy: A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to the use of this emergency contraceptive method.\r Repeated Use: Peuli is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of Peuli within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.\r Fertility Following Use: A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with Peuli for emergency contraception. So, to prevent pregnancy on a later episode of sexual intercourse one should use the barrier method (ex. Condom).\r Effect on Menstrual Cycle: After Peuli intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. 7% of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, a pregnancy test should be performed. 9% of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after the use of Peuli.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren and Adolescents: Limited safety and efficacy data available on women under 18 years old.\r Hepatic Impairment: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Peuli.\r Renal Impairment: No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of Peuli.\rOverdose Effects\rExperience with Peuli overdose is limited, in a clinical study, a single dose equivalent to four times Peuli was administered to a limited number of subjects without any adverse reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs acting on the Uterus, Emergency Contraceptive Pill\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a dry and cool place, protected from sunlight.

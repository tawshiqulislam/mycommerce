        "description": "Indications\rShampoo: Nizoder shampoo is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections in which the yeast Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) is involved, such as pityriasis versicolor (localized), seborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis (dandruff).\r Cream: Nizoder 2% cream is used for topical application in the treatment of dermatophyte infections of the skin such as tinea corporis, tinea cruris (dhobie itch), tinea manus and tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) infections due to Trichophyton spp, Microsporon spp and Epidermophyton spp. Nizoder 2% cream is also indicated for the treatment of cutaneous candidosis (including vulvitis), candidal intertrigo (sweat rash), tinea (pityriasis) versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis caused by Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) spp.\r Tablet: Treatment of superficial and deep mycoses:\rInfections of the skin, hair and nails by dermatophytes and/or yeasts (dermatomycosis, onychomycosis, perionyxis, pityriasis versicolor, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis etc.) especially when topical treatment is difficult or not very effective, owing to involvement of large skin surfaces or to lesions affecting deeper dermal layers, nails and hairs\rYeast infection of the mouth (oral thrush, perleche) and the gastrointestinal tract\rVaginal candidiasis, especially chronic recurrent cases or cases responding poorly to topcial treatment\rSystemic mycotic infections such as systemic candidiasis, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis etc.\rMaintenance treatment to prevent recurrence in systemic mycotic infections and in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.\r Prophylactic treatment to prevent mycotic infection in patients with reduced host defenses, e.g., patients with cancer, organ transplant and burns.\r Nizoder bar: This in indicated for All Kinds of Body Fungus.\rPharmacology\rKetoconazole interacts with 14-α-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed.\rDosage & Administration\rShampoo: The affected areas of the skin or the scalp should be washed with ketoconazole 2% shampoo, which should be left on the skin/scalp for 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing.\r Treatment:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 5 days.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Twice weekly for 2 to 4 weeks.\rProphylaxis:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 3 days during a single treatment course before the summer.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Once every 1 or 2 weeks.\rCream:\rTinea pedis: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas twice daily. The usual duration of treatment for mild infections is 1 week. For more severe or extensive infections (e.g. involving the sole or sides of the feet) treatment should be continued until a few days after all signs and symptoms have disappeared in order to prevent relapse.\rFor other infections: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the infection. The treatment should be continued until a few days after the disappearance of all signs and symptoms. The usual duration of treatment is: tinea versicolor 2-3 weeks, tinea corporis 3-4 weeks. The diagnosis should be reconsidered if no clinical improvement is noted after 4 weeks. General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic condition and relapse is highly likely.\rTablet:\rVaginal candidiasis: 1 tablet (200 mg) tablet twice daily for 5 days.\rAll other indications: 1 tablet (200 mg) once daily until at least one week after the symptoms have disappeared and the cultures have become negative.\rDuration of Treatment-\rPityriasis versicolor: 1 to 6 weeks\rDermatomycoses: 2 to 8 weeks\rOnychomycoses: 1 to 12 months\rMycoses of hair and scalp: 1 to 2 months\rChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis : 1 to 12 months\rOral mycoses: 5 to 10 days\rSystemic candidiasis: 1 to 2 months\rParacoccidioidomycosis,histoplasmosis\rand other systemic mycosis: 1 month to 2 years\rKetoconazole bar: Body Fungus: rub gently on the overall body to produce lather. Leave for 4-5 minutes. Rinse of thoroughly with water.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rShampoo and Cream:  No information was found.\r Tablet: Reduced absorption with antimuscarinics, antacids, H2-blockers, PPIs and sucralfate. Reduced plasma concentrations with rifampicin, isoniazid, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin. May also reduce concentrations of isoniazid and rifampicin. May reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. May increase serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates e.g. digoxin, oral anticoagulants, sildenafil, tacrolimus.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole.\rSide Effects\rShampoo:  Topical treatment with Nizoder shampoo 2% is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy) may occur on exposed areas. Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of Nizoder shampoo 2%.\r Cream: Commonly observed adverse reactions to Nizoder cream in clinical trials were skin application site burning sensation, erythema and pruritus. Uncommon adverse reactions are application site bleeding, discomfort, dryness, inflammation, irritation, paraesthesia and reaction; bullous eruption, dermatitis contact, rash, skin exfoliation and sticky skin.\r Tablet: Nizoder is very well tolerated. Nausea and itching may occasionally occur. In some patients, an idosyncratic liver reaction may occur (incidence 1:10000).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rShampoo: Since ketoconazole is not absorbed through the skin after topical application, pregnancy and lactation are not a contraindication for the use of ketoconazole shampoo 2%.\r Cream: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of topical Ketoconazole on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity following oral administration of Ketoconazole. No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.\r Tablet: Pregnancy category C. There is no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rShampoo: In patients who have been on prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroids, it is recommended that the steroid therapy be gradually withdrawn over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while using Nizoder shampoo 2%, to prevent any potential rebound effect. Increased hair shedding is often associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff, and has been rarely reported with the use of Nizoder shampoo 2%. Avoid contact with the eyes. If the shampoo should get into the eyes, they should be bathed with water.\r Cream: Not for ophthalmic use. If a potent topical corticosteroid has been used previously in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, a recovery period of 2 weeks should be allowed before using Nizoder 2% w/w cream, as an increased incidence of steroid induced skin sensitisation has been reported when no recovery period is allowed.\r Tablet: In patients with a previous history of liver disease, liver enzyme levels should be monitored during treatment. When patients develop symptoms indicative of liver reaction, such as nausea or fatigue, accompanied with pale faeces, dark urine or jaundice, Nizoder therapy should be stopped immediately\rOverdose Effects\rShampoo: Not expected as Nizoder shampoo 2% is intended for external use only. In the event of accidental ingestion, only supportive measures should be carried out. To avoid aspiration, emesis or gastric lavage should not be performed.\r Cream: Exaggerated topical application may lead to erythema, oedema and a burning sensation, which will disappear upon discontinuation of the treatment. If accidental ingestion of Nizoder 2% w/w cream occurs, no special measures have to be taken.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for subcutaneous and mycoses\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 25°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rSoricap is indicated in severe extensive psoriasis which is resistant to other forms of therapy, palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, severe congenital ichthyosis, severe Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis).\rPharmacology\rAcitretin is a retinoid, an aromatic analogue of vitamin A. The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however, evidence exists for a wide range of actions at various cellular and subcellular levels. These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and elderly: Initial daily dose should be 25 mg or 30 mg for 2 to 4 weeks. After this initial treatment period the involved areas of the skin should show a marked response and/or side-effects should be apparent. In general, a daily dosage of 25-50 mg taken for a further 6 to 8 weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic results. However, it may be necessary in some cases to increase the dose up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.\r In patients with Darier’s disease a starting dose of 10 mg may be appropriate. The dose should be increased cautiously as isomorphic reactions may occur. Patients with severe congenital ichthyosis and severe Darier’s disease may require therapy beyond 3 months. The lowest effective dosage, not exceeding 50mg/day, should be given. Continuous use beyond 6 months is contra-indicated as only limited clinical data are available on patients treated beyond this length of time.\r Children: The daily dosage is about 0.5mg/kg. Higher doses (up to 1mg/kg daily) may be necessary in some cases for limited periods, but only up to a maximum of 35 mg/day.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rExisting data suggests that concurrent intake of Soricap with ethanol led to the formation of etretinate. Concomitant administration of methotrexate, tetracyclines or vitamin A and other retinoids with Soricap is contraindicated. In concurrent treatment with phenytoin, it must be remembered that Soricap partially reduces the protein binding of phenytoin. Low dose progesterone-only products (minipills) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Soricap therapy, Investigations into the effect of Soricap on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.\rContraindications\rAcitretin is highly teratogenic and must not be used by women who are pregnant. The same applies to women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is practiced 4 weeks before, during and for 2 years after treatment. The use of Acitretin is contra-indicated in women who are breast feeding.Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values. Concomitant administration of Acitretin with other retinoids or Vitamin A is contra-indicated due to the risk of hypervitaminosis A. Acitretin is contra-indicated in cases of hypersensitivity to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids. Patients with rare glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicine.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects are seen in most patients receiving Soricap. Most of the clinical side-effects of Soricap are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Soricap is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAcitretin is contraindicated in pregnant women or nursing mother. It is highly teratogenic. Its use is contraindicated in women who might become pregnant during or within 2 years of the cessation of treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe risk of giving birth to a deformed child is exceptionally high if Soricap is taken before or during pregnancy, no matter for how long or at what dosage. Women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with Soricap. Donation of blood by a patient being treated with Soricap is prohibited during and for two years after completion of treatment with Soricap. The effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoid therapy; therefore patients should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Hepatic function should be checked before starting treatment with Soricap, every 1-2 weeks for the first 2 months after commencement and then every 3 months during treatment. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides (fasting values) must be monitored before starting treatment, one month after the commencement and then every 3 months during treatment, especially in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Retinoids can alter glucose tolerance, blood sugar levels should therefore be checked. Patients should be warned of the possibility of alopecia. Decreased night vision has been reported with Soricap therapy. Patients with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances should discontinue Soricap immediately.\rOverdose Effects\rManifestations of acute Vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, vertigo, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Soricap would probably be similar. Specific treatment is unnecessary because of the low acute toxicity of the preparation.\rTherapeutic Class\rOral Retinoid preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place, protected from light. Do not store above 25°C.\r\nIndications\r\nSoricap is indicated in severe extensive psoriasis which is resistant to other forms of therapy, palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, severe congenital ichthyosis, severe Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis).\r\nPharmacology\r\nAcitretin is a retinoid, an aromatic analogue of vitamin A.

The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however, evidence exists for a wide range of actions at various cellular and subcellular levels. These include regulation of RNA/DNA synthesis, modulation of factors which influence epidermal proliferation, modification of glycoprotein synthesis and modulation of the immune response. Whatever the exact mechanism of action, the most prominent effect of acitretin is a modulation of cellular differentiation in the epidermis which re-establishes a more normal pattern of cell growth.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult and elderly: Initial daily dose should be 25 mg or 30 mg for 2 to 4 weeks. After this initial treatment period the involved areas of the skin should show a marked response and/or side-effects should be apparent. In general, a daily dosage of 25-50 mg taken for a further 6 to 8 weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic results. However, it may be necessary in some cases to increase the dose up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.\r In patients with Darier’s disease a starting dose of 10 mg may be appropriate. The dose should be increased cautiously as isomorphic reactions may occur. Patients with severe congenital ichthyosis and severe Darier’s disease may require therapy beyond 3 months. The lowest effective dosage, not exceeding 50mg/day, should be given. Continuous use beyond 6 months is contra-indicated as only limited clinical data are available on patients treated beyond this length of time.\r Children: The daily dosage is about 0.5mg/kg. Higher doses (up to 1mg/kg daily) may be necessary in some cases for limited periods, but only up to a maximum of 35 mg/day.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rExisting data suggests that concurrent intake of Soricap with ethanol led to the formation of etretinate. Concomitant administration of methotrexate, tetracyclines or vitamin A and other retinoids with Soricap is contraindicated. In concurrent treatment with phenytoin, it must be remembered that Soricap partially reduces the protein binding of phenytoin. Low dose progesterone-only products (minipills) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Soricap therapy, Investigations into the effect of Soricap on the protein binding of anticoagulants of the coumarin type (warfarin) revealed no interaction.\rContraindications\rAcitretin is highly teratogenic and must not be used by women who are pregnant. The same applies to women of childbearing potential unless strict contraception is practiced 4 weeks before, during and for 2 years after treatment. The use of Acitretin is contra-indicated in women who are breast feeding.Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values. Concomitant administration of Acitretin with other retinoids or Vitamin A is contra-indicated due to the risk of hypervitaminosis A. Acitretin is contra-indicated in cases of hypersensitivity to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids. Patients with rare glucose-galactosemalabsorption should not take this medicine.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects are seen in most patients receiving Soricap. Most of the clinical side-effects of Soricap are dose-related and are usually well-tolerated at the recommended dosages. However, the toxic dose of Soricap is close to the therapeutic dose and most patients experience some side-effects during theinitial period whilst dosage is being adjusted. The skin and mucous membranes are most commonly affected. An initial worsening of psoriasis symptoms issometimes seen at the beginning of the treatment period.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAcitretin is contraindicated in pregnant women or nursing mother. It is highly teratogenic. Its use is contraindicated in women who might become pregnant during or within 2 years of the cessation of treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThe risk of giving birth to a deformed child is exceptionally high if Soricap is taken before or during pregnancy, no matter for how long or at what dosage. Women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with Soricap. Donation of blood by a patient being treated with Soricap is prohibited during and for two years after completion of treatment with Soricap. The effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoid therapy; therefore patients should avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Hepatic function should be checked before starting treatment with Soricap, every 1-2 weeks for the first 2 months after commencement and then every 3 months during treatment. Serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides (fasting values) must be monitored before starting treatment, one month after the commencement and then every 3 months during treatment, especially in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Retinoids can alter glucose tolerance, blood sugar levels should therefore be checked. Patients should be warned of the possibility of alopecia. Decreased night vision has been reported with Soricap therapy. Patients with severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances should discontinue Soricap immediately.\rOverdose Effects\rManifestations of acute Vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, vertigo, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Soricap would probably be similar. Specific treatment is unnecessary because of the low acute toxicity of the preparation.\rTherapeutic Class\rOral Retinoid preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool & dry place, protected from light. Do not store above 25°C.\nIndications\r\nSoricap is indicated in severe extensive psoriasis which is resistant to other forms of therapy, palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, severe congenital ichthyosis, severe Darier’s disease (keratosis follicularis).\r\nPharmacology\r\nAcitretin is a retinoid, an aromatic analogue of vitamin A.

        "description": "Indications\rShampoo: Nizoder shampoo is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections in which the yeast Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) is involved, such as pityriasis versicolor (localized), seborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis (dandruff).\r Cream: Nizoder 2% cream is used for topical application in the treatment of dermatophyte infections of the skin such as tinea corporis, tinea cruris (dhobie itch), tinea manus and tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) infections due to Trichophyton spp, Microsporon spp and Epidermophyton spp. Nizoder 2% cream is also indicated for the treatment of cutaneous candidosis (including vulvitis), candidal intertrigo (sweat rash), tinea (pityriasis) versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis caused by Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) spp.\r Tablet: Treatment of superficial and deep mycoses:\rInfections of the skin, hair and nails by dermatophytes and/or yeasts (dermatomycosis, onychomycosis, perionyxis, pityriasis versicolor, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis etc.) especially when topical treatment is difficult or not very effective, owing to involvement of large skin surfaces or to lesions affecting deeper dermal layers, nails and hairs\rYeast infection of the mouth (oral thrush, perleche) and the gastrointestinal tract\rVaginal candidiasis, especially chronic recurrent cases or cases responding poorly to topcial treatment\rSystemic mycotic infections such as systemic candidiasis, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis etc.\rMaintenance treatment to prevent recurrence in systemic mycotic infections and in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.\r Prophylactic treatment to prevent mycotic infection in patients with reduced host defenses, e.g., patients with cancer, organ transplant and burns.\r Nizoder bar: This in indicated for All Kinds of Body Fungus.\rPharmacology\rKetoconazole interacts with 14-α-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed.\rDosage & Administration\rShampoo: The affected areas of the skin or the scalp should be washed with ketoconazole 2% shampoo, which should be left on the skin/scalp for 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing.\r Treatment:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 5 days.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Twice weekly for 2 to 4 weeks.\rProphylaxis:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 3 days during a single treatment course before the summer.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Once every 1 or 2 weeks.\rCream:\rTinea pedis: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas twice daily. The usual duration of treatment for mild infections is 1 week. For more severe or extensive infections (e.g. involving the sole or sides of the feet) treatment should be continued until a few days after all signs and symptoms have disappeared in order to prevent relapse.\rFor other infections: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the infection. The treatment should be continued until a few days after the disappearance of all signs and symptoms. The usual duration of treatment is: tinea versicolor 2-3 weeks, tinea corporis 3-4 weeks. The diagnosis should be reconsidered if no clinical improvement is noted after 4 weeks. General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic condition and relapse is highly likely.\rTablet:\rVaginal candidiasis: 1 tablet (200 mg) tablet twice daily for 5 days.\rAll other indications: 1 tablet (200 mg) once daily until at least one week after the symptoms have disappeared and the cultures have become negative.\rDuration of Treatment-\rPityriasis versicolor: 1 to 6 weeks\rDermatomycoses: 2 to 8 weeks\rOnychomycoses: 1 to 12 months\rMycoses of hair and scalp: 1 to 2 months\rChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis : 1 to 12 months\rOral mycoses: 5 to 10 days\rSystemic candidiasis: 1 to 2 months\rParacoccidioidomycosis,histoplasmosis\rand other systemic mycosis: 1 month to 2 years\rKetoconazole bar: Body Fungus: rub gently on the overall body to produce lather. Leave for 4-5 minutes. Rinse of thoroughly with water.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rShampoo and Cream:  No information was found.\r Tablet: Reduced absorption with antimuscarinics, antacids, H2-blockers, PPIs and sucralfate. Reduced plasma concentrations with rifampicin, isoniazid, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin. May also reduce concentrations of isoniazid and rifampicin. May reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. May increase serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates e.g. digoxin, oral anticoagulants, sildenafil, tacrolimus.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole.\rSide Effects\rShampoo:  Topical treatment with Nizoder shampoo 2% is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy) may occur on exposed areas. Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of Nizoder shampoo 2%.\r Cream: Commonly observed adverse reactions to Nizoder cream in clinical trials were skin application site burning sensation, erythema and pruritus. Uncommon adverse reactions are application site bleeding, discomfort, dryness, inflammation, irritation, paraesthesia and reaction; bullous eruption, dermatitis contact, rash, skin exfoliation and sticky skin.\r Tablet: Nizoder is very well tolerated. Nausea and itching may occasionally occur. In some patients, an idosyncratic liver reaction may occur (incidence 1:10000).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rShampoo: Since ketoconazole is not absorbed through the skin after topical application, pregnancy and lactation are not a contraindication for the use of ketoconazole shampoo 2%.\r Cream: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of topical Ketoconazole on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity following oral administration of Ketoconazole. No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.\r Tablet: Pregnancy category C. There is no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rShampoo: In patients who have been on prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroids, it is recommended that the steroid therapy be gradually withdrawn over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while using Nizoder shampoo 2%, to prevent any potential rebound effect. Increased hair shedding is often associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff, and has been rarely reported with the use of Nizoder shampoo 2%. Avoid contact with the eyes. If the shampoo should get into the eyes, they should be bathed with water.\r Cream: Not for ophthalmic use. If a potent topical corticosteroid has been used previously in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, a recovery period of 2 weeks should be allowed before using Nizoder 2% w/w cream, as an increased incidence of steroid induced skin sensitisation has been reported when no recovery period is allowed.\r Tablet: In patients with a previous history of liver disease, liver enzyme levels should be monitored during treatment. When patients develop symptoms indicative of liver reaction, such as nausea or fatigue, accompanied with pale faeces, dark urine or jaundice, Nizoder therapy should be stopped immediately\rOverdose Effects\rShampoo: Not expected as Nizoder shampoo 2% is intended for external use only. In the event of accidental ingestion, only supportive measures should be carried out. To avoid aspiration, emesis or gastric lavage should not be performed.\r Cream: Exaggerated topical application may lead to erythema, oedema and a burning sensation, which will disappear upon discontinuation of the treatment. If accidental ingestion of Nizoder 2% w/w cream occurs, no special measures have to be taken.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for subcutaneous and mycoses\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 25°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.\rDosage & Administration\rHydrocortisone Acetate should be applied in a small quantity to the affected area 2 or 3 times daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rInfections: bacterial, viral, fungal.\rSkin ulcers.\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rTopicort 1% cream is usually well-tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is inadequate evidence for safety in human pregnancy.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Nyclobate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r\n \nIf applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r\n \nTopical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r\n \nAppropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Topical corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture. Do not freeze. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rNyclobate NN is indicated in-\rShort courses treatment of recalcitrant eczemas.\rNeurodermatoses.\rPsoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis) where secondary bacterial infection or fungal infection is present, suspected or likely to occur.\rOther inflammatory conditions which do not respond satisfactorily to less active steroids.\rPharmacology\rClobetasol Propionate is a very potent corticosteroid. It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.\r Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.\r Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNeomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\rContraindications\rThis medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur. No overdose-related problem yet reported. However, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation, topical steroids should be discontinued gradually.\rTherapeutic Class\rClobetasol / Clobetasone & Combined Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 25°C temperature.

        "description": "Indications\rShampoo: Dancel shampoo is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections in which the yeast Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) is involved, such as pityriasis versicolor (localized), seborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis (dandruff).\r Cream: Dancel 2% cream is used for topical application in the treatment of dermatophyte infections of the skin such as tinea corporis, tinea cruris (dhobie itch), tinea manus and tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) infections due to Trichophyton spp, Microsporon spp and Epidermophyton spp. Dancel 2% cream is also indicated for the treatment of cutaneous candidosis (including vulvitis), candidal intertrigo (sweat rash), tinea (pityriasis) versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis caused by Malassezia (previously called Pityrosporum) spp.\r Tablet: Treatment of superficial and deep mycoses:\rInfections of the skin, hair and nails by dermatophytes and/or yeasts (dermatomycosis, onychomycosis, perionyxis, pityriasis versicolor, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis etc.) especially when topical treatment is difficult or not very effective, owing to involvement of large skin surfaces or to lesions affecting deeper dermal layers, nails and hairs\rYeast infection of the mouth (oral thrush, perleche) and the gastrointestinal tract\rVaginal candidiasis, especially chronic recurrent cases or cases responding poorly to topcial treatment\rSystemic mycotic infections such as systemic candidiasis, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis etc.\rMaintenance treatment to prevent recurrence in systemic mycotic infections and in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.\r Prophylactic treatment to prevent mycotic infection in patients with reduced host defenses, e.g., patients with cancer, organ transplant and burns.\r Dancel bar: This in indicated for All Kinds of Body Fungus.\rPharmacology\rKetoconazole interacts with 14-α-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed.\rDosage & Administration\rShampoo: The affected areas of the skin or the scalp should be washed with ketoconazole 2% shampoo, which should be left on the skin/scalp for 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing.\r Treatment:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 5 days.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Twice weekly for 2 to 4 weeks.\rProphylaxis:\rPityriasis versicolor: Once daily for 3 days during a single treatment course before the summer.\rSeborrhoeic dermatitis and pityriasis capitis: Once every 1 or 2 weeks.\rCream:\rTinea pedis: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas twice daily. The usual duration of treatment for mild infections is 1 week. For more severe or extensive infections (e.g. involving the sole or sides of the feet) treatment should be continued until a few days after all signs and symptoms have disappeared in order to prevent relapse.\rFor other infections: Ketoconazole cream should be applied to the affected areas once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the infection. The treatment should be continued until a few days after the disappearance of all signs and symptoms. The usual duration of treatment is: tinea versicolor 2-3 weeks, tinea corporis 3-4 weeks. The diagnosis should be reconsidered if no clinical improvement is noted after 4 weeks. General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic condition and relapse is highly likely.\rTablet:\rVaginal candidiasis: 1 tablet (200 mg) tablet twice daily for 5 days.\rAll other indications: 1 tablet (200 mg) once daily until at least one week after the symptoms have disappeared and the cultures have become negative.\rDuration of Treatment-\rPityriasis versicolor: 1 to 6 weeks\rDermatomycoses: 2 to 8 weeks\rOnychomycoses: 1 to 12 months\rMycoses of hair and scalp: 1 to 2 months\rChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis : 1 to 12 months\rOral mycoses: 5 to 10 days\rSystemic candidiasis: 1 to 2 months\rParacoccidioidomycosis,histoplasmosis\rand other systemic mycosis: 1 month to 2 years\rKetoconazole bar: Body Fungus: rub gently on the overall body to produce lather. Leave for 4-5 minutes. Rinse of thoroughly with water.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rShampoo and Cream:  No information was found.\r Tablet: Reduced absorption with antimuscarinics, antacids, H2-blockers, PPIs and sucralfate. Reduced plasma concentrations with rifampicin, isoniazid, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin. May also reduce concentrations of isoniazid and rifampicin. May reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. May increase serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates e.g. digoxin, oral anticoagulants, sildenafil, tacrolimus.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole.\rSide Effects\rShampoo:  Topical treatment with Dancel shampoo 2% is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy) may occur on exposed areas. Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of Dancel shampoo 2%.\r Cream: Commonly observed adverse reactions to Dancel cream in clinical trials were skin application site burning sensation, erythema and pruritus. Uncommon adverse reactions are application site bleeding, discomfort, dryness, inflammation, irritation, paraesthesia and reaction; bullous eruption, dermatitis contact, rash, skin exfoliation and sticky skin.\r Tablet: Dancel is very well tolerated. Nausea and itching may occasionally occur. In some patients, an idosyncratic liver reaction may occur (incidence 1:10000).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rShampoo: Since ketoconazole is not absorbed through the skin after topical application, pregnancy and lactation are not a contraindication for the use of ketoconazole shampoo 2%.\r Cream: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of topical Ketoconazole on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity following oral administration of Ketoconazole. No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.\r Tablet: Pregnancy category C. There is no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rShampoo: In patients who have been on prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroids, it is recommended that the steroid therapy be gradually withdrawn over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while using Dancel shampoo 2%, to prevent any potential rebound effect. Increased hair shedding is often associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff, and has been rarely reported with the use of Dancel shampoo 2%. Avoid contact with the eyes. If the shampoo should get into the eyes, they should be bathed with water.\r Cream: Not for ophthalmic use. If a potent topical corticosteroid has been used previously in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, a recovery period of 2 weeks should be allowed before using Dancel 2% w/w cream, as an increased incidence of steroid induced skin sensitisation has been reported when no recovery period is allowed.\r Tablet: In patients with a previous history of liver disease, liver enzyme levels should be monitored during treatment. When patients develop symptoms indicative of liver reaction, such as nausea or fatigue, accompanied with pale faeces, dark urine or jaundice, Dancel therapy should be stopped immediately\rOverdose Effects\rShampoo: Not expected as Dancel shampoo 2% is intended for external use only. In the event of accidental ingestion, only supportive measures should be carried out. To avoid aspiration, emesis or gastric lavage should not be performed.\r Cream: Exaggerated topical application may lead to erythema, oedema and a burning sensation, which will disappear upon discontinuation of the treatment. If accidental ingestion of Dancel 2% w/w cream occurs, no special measures have to be taken.\rTherapeutic Class\rDrugs for subcutaneous and mycoses\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 25°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Oily and dry hair have been reported rarely with the use of Dancel shampoo 2%.\r\n \nCream: Commonly observed adverse reactions to Dancel cream in clinical trials were skin application site burning sensation, erythema and pruritus. Uncommon adverse reactions are application site bleeding, discomfort, dryness, inflammation, irritation, paraesthesia and reaction; bullous eruption, dermatitis contact, rash, skin exfoliation and sticky skin.\r\n \nTablet: Dancel is very well tolerated. Nausea and itching may occasionally occur. In some patients, an idosyncratic liver reaction may occur (incidence 1:10000).\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nShampoo: Since ketoconazole is not absorbed through the skin after topical application, pregnancy and lactation are not a contraindication for the use of ketoconazole shampoo 2%.\r\n \nCream: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women. To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of topical Ketoconazole on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity following oral administration of Ketoconazole. No effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated.\r\n \nTablet: Pregnancy category C. There is no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole Tablets should not be used during pregnancy and lactation.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nShampoo: In patients who have been on prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroids, it is recommended that the steroid therapy be gradually withdrawn over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while using Dancel shampoo 2%, to prevent any potential rebound effect. Increased hair shedding is often associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff, and has been rarely reported with the use of Dancel shampoo 2%. Avoid contact with the eyes. If the shampoo should get into the eyes, they should be bathed with water.\r\n \nCream: Not for ophthalmic use. If a potent topical corticosteroid has been used previously in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, a recovery period of 2 weeks should be allowed before using Dancel 2% w/w cream, as an increased incidence of steroid induced skin sensitisation has been reported when no recovery period is allowed.\r\n \nTablet: In patients with a previous history of liver disease, liver enzyme levels should be monitored during treatment. When patients develop symptoms indicative of liver reaction, such as nausea or fatigue, accompanied with pale faeces, dark urine or jaundice, Dancel therapy should be stopped immediately\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nShampoo: Not expected as Dancel shampoo 2% is intended for external use only. In the event of accidental ingestion, only supportive measures should be carried out. To avoid aspiration, emesis or gastric lavage should not be performed.\r\n \nCream: Exaggerated topical application may lead to erythema, oedema and a burning sensation, which will disappear upon discontinuation of the treatment. If accidental ingestion of Dancel 2% w/w cream occurs, no special measures have to be taken.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nDrugs for subcutaneous and mycoses\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 25°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC26H28Cl2N4O4\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Ketoconazole\r\nCommon Questions about Dancel 2% Shampoo\r\nWhat is Dancel 2% Shampoo?\r\nDancel 2% Shampoo belongs to the class of drugs called azole antifungals. It works by stopping the growth of the fungus.\r\nWhat is Dancel 2% Shampoo used for?\r\nDancel 2% Shampoo is an antiandrogen, antifungal, and antiglucocorticoid medication used to treat a number of fungal infections.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'",

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Clovate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.\r Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.\r Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNeomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\rContraindications\rThis medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion.

        "description": "Indications\rTrugain is indicated in the treatment of androgenic alopecia in males and females and stabilisation of hair loss in patients with androgenic alopecia, and also of alopecia areata.\rPharmacology\rMinoxidil stimulates hair growth by increasing oxygen, blood and nutrients supply to the hair follicle by widening blood vessels and inhibiting androgen hormone to affect hair follicles.\r Following topical application, an average of about 1.4% of the total applied dose is absorbed from the normal intact scalp. Topical Minoxidil absorption is increased by increasing the  dose applied, increasing the frequency of dosing and decreasing the barrier function of the stratum corneum. Serum Minoxidil levels and systemic effects resulting from the administration of topical Minoxidil are governed by the drug’s absorption rate through the skin. Following cessation of topical dosing, approximately 95% of the systemically absorbed drug is eliminated within 4 days. Minoxidil and its metabolites are excreted principally in the urine.\rDosage & Administration\rMinoxidil topical solution is for external use only and should be applied when the hair and scalp are clean and dry. Apply 1 ml (7 sprays) of Minoxidil topical solution twice daily at 12-hour intervals to the scalp, beginning at the centre of the affected area and spreading the solution out to cover the entire affected area. The total daily application dose should not exceed 2 ml.\r For the best results, Minoxidil topical solution should be allowed to remain on the scalp for about 4 hours before washing. The night-time application should be done 2-4 hours before going to bed to allow the solution to dry out. Minoxidil topical solution should not be massaged into the scalp, but applied lightly. A hair dryer should not be used to speed up the drying of the solution as it may decrease the effectiveness. Minoxidil topical solution should not be mixed with any hair oil. The drug should not be used more than two times a day, or be taken orally or applied to any other part of the body to avoid the risk of adverse effects and unwanted hair growth. More frequent use or longer application time have no effect on hair growth. In case of missing any daily applications of Minoxidil topical solution, the patient should continue with the next application.\r Hands should be washed immediately if Minoxidil topical solution is applied with the fingertips. Clinical experience with Minoxidil indicates that twice-daily applications for 4 months or more may be required before there is evidence of hair growth. To arrest hair fall, Minoxidil topical solution should be used for not less than 45 days.

        "description": "Indications\rBiotin is indicated in-\rHair loss\rWeak, brittle, splitting or soft nails\rEczema & dermatitis.\rPharmacology\rBiotin is an essential vitamin that is also known as vitamin H. It is involved in vital physiological function like fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis. It acts as a cofactor in the enzymatic carboxylation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Biotin influences the growth and differentiation of epidermal cells and is therefore important for the formation and renewal of the skin, hair and nails. It functions as a coenzyme for mitochondrial carboxylases in hair roots and improves the keratin structure. Biotin deficiency may result in hair loss and a variety of systemic symptoms such as dermatitis, and aciduria. Biotin is one of the most prescribed nutritional supplements for any kind of hair loss.\rDosage & Administration\rBiotin dose varies depending on disease condition and age group.\r In adults: Generally 1-3 tablets per day or as advised by the physician.\r In children: biotin deficiency affects between 1 week and 2 years of age and usually exhibits seizures, hypotonia, developmental delay, ataxia, hyperventilation, and coma. In this case, 5-10 tablets daily, crushed and mixed with water or any kind of fruit juice or as advised by the physician.\r Recommended dietary allowance:\r Infants-\r0-6 months: 5 mcg/day\r7-12 months: 6 mcg/day\rChildren-\r1-3 years: 8 mcg/day\r4-8 years: 12 mcg/day\rMales and females-\r9-13 years: 20 mcg/day\r14-18 years: 25 mcg/day\r≥19 years: 30 mcg/day\rPregnancy: 30 mcg/day\r Lactation: 35 mcg/day\r Interaction\rThere are indications that anticonvulsant drugs lower the plasma level of biotin. Antibiotic use may decrease the biotin contribution to the body made by the microflora of the large intestine. Excessive consumption of raw egg whites interferes with biotin absorption.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.\rSide Effects\rWell tolerated in the recommended dose. No biotin toxicity has been reported in individuals supplemented with as much as 200 mg orally or 20mg intravenously per day.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rSufficient clinical data is not available to use in pregnant women and lactating mother.\rTherapeutic Class\rHerbal and Nutraceuticals\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, away from light and moisture.

The Vascular Endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\ris stimulated by Minoxidil and VEGF is presumably responsible for the increased capillary fenestration, indicative of a metabolic\ractivity observed during the anagen phase.\r  INDICATIONS\r Minoxidil indicated for the treatment of alopecia androgenetica in men and women aged between 18 and 65.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Hair and scalp should be thoroughly dry prior to topical application of Minoxidil. A dose of 1 ml Minoxidil cutaneous solution\rshould be applied to the total affected areas of the scalp twice daily. The total dosage should not exceed 2 ml.

Minoxidil should not be\r\nused during pregnancy.\r\nLactation: It is recommended that breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Minoxidil.\r\n \n \nDRUG INTERACTION\r\n \nTopical drugs, such as corticosteroids, tretinoin, dithranol or petrolatum which alter the stratum corneum barrier, could result\r\nin increased absorption of Minoxidil if applied concurrently. Although it has not been demonstrated clinically, there exists the\r\ntheoretical possibility of absorbed minoxidil potentiating orthostatic hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilators.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nIncreased systemic absorption of Minoxidil may potentially occur if higher-than-recommended doses of Minoxidil are applied to\r\nlarger surface areas of the body or areas other than the scalp. There are no known cases of Minoxidil overdosage resulting from\r\ntopical administration of Minoxidil.\r\nSigns and symptoms of Minoxidil overdosage would primarily be cardiovascular effects associated with sodium and water retention,\r\nand tachycardia. Fluid retention can be managed with appropriate diuretic therapy. Clinically significant tachycardia can be\r\ncontrolled by administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent.\r\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nXenogrow 2%: Each bottle contains 60 ml solution of Minoxidil USP 2%.\r\nXenogrow 5%: Each bottle contains 60 ml solution of Minoxidil USP 5%.",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMonas has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair. No dosage adjustment for Provair is recommended.

Salbutamol Sulphate is a\rbeta2-adrenergic agent which acts on airway smooth muscle resulting in relaxation. Salbutamol relaxes all smooth muscle from the\rtrachea to the terminal bronchioles and protects against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Ipratropium Bromide is a quaternary\rammonium compound with anticholinergic properties. In preclinical studies, it appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by\rantagonising the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the\rincrease of intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with\rmuscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium Bromide is primarily\rlocal and site specific to the lung and not systemic in nature. Windel Plus provides the simultaneous release of Ipratropium\rBromide and Salbutamol allowing the synergistic efficacy on the muscarinic and beta2-adrenergic receptors in the airways to cause\rbronchodilation which is superior to that provided by each single agent and with no potentiation of adverse events.\r  INDICATIONS\r Windel Plus is indicated for the treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with obstructive airway diseases in patients who\rrequire more than a single bronchodilator.\r    DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Windel Plus inhalation solution in ampoule may be administered from a suitable nebuliser or an intermittent positive pressure\rventilator.\r Adults (including elderly): One ampoule as required for the relief of symptoms or as directed. Up to three to four ampoules daily.\r Patients should be advised to consult a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately in the case of acute or rapidly worsening\rdyspnoea if additional inhalations do not produce an adequate improvement.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Windel Plus inhalation solution in ampoule may be administered from a suitable nebuliser or an intermittent positive pressure\rventilator.\r Adults (including elderly): One ampoule as required for the relief of symptoms or as directed.

No\rsuspect teratogenic factors have been observed in general practice or clinical studies. As a general precaution, however, Windel\rPlus should only be used in pregnancy and during the lactation period if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any\rpossible risk to the child.\r Windel Plus should be used with caution before childbirth in view of Salbutamol's inhibitory effects on uterine contractions.\r Salbutamol Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide are probably excreted in breast milk and their effects on neonates are not known.\rAlthough lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that this will happen to any extent especially\rwhen taken by inhalation. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when Windel Plus is\radministered to a nursing woman.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r The concurrent administration of other beta-mimetics, systemically absorbed anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives may increase\rthe side effects.\rBeta-agonist induced hypokalaemia may be increased by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, glucocorticosteroids and\rdiuretics. This should be taken into account particularly in patients with severe airway obstruction.\r Hypokalaemia may result in an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients receiving digoxin.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Lumona did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Lumona was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Lumona approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Lumona. No dosage adjustment for Lumona is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Lumona.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLumona is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Lumona can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Lumona should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Lumona should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Lumona.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nLumona has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Lumona did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Lumona was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Lumona approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Lumona. No dosage adjustment for Lumona is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Lumona.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLumona is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Lumona can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Lumona should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Lumona should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Lumona.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Bexitrol F contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Bexitrol F inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Bexitrol F inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r\n \nSalmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r\n \nFluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\r\nDosage\r\nInhaler:\r\nAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r\nChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r\n \nInhalation capsule (for asthma):\r\nAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \r\nThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \r\nThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\r\nPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\r\nInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r\n \n \nMaxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r\n \nAdults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r\n50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\n50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\n50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\nChildren (4 years and older)-\r\n50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMonas has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nProvair ODT has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Provair ODT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Provair ODT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Provair ODT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Provair ODT. No dosage adjustment for Provair ODT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Provair ODT.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nProvair ODT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Provair ODT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Provair ODT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Provair ODT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Provair ODT. Although Provair ODT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Provair ODT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Protide contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Protide inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Protide inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNo human over dosage data has been reported for Protide inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r\n \nSalmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\n \nFluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Protide inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty.

Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Protide contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Protide inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily.

Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r\n \nFormoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\r\nDosage\r\nInhaler (For Asthma)-\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\r\nChildren (4 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r\n200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r\n400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r\n \nFollowing simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\r\nTake off the cap.\r\nShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\r\nIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\r\nBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\r\nPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\r\nWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\r\nRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\r\nIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\r\nAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\r\nCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\r\nInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\r\nPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\r\nHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r\n \nFormoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r\n \nBudesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.",

Fluticasone Propionate, an individual component of this inhaler, is a substrate of CYP 3A4. The effects of short-term co-administration of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. Ritonavir, Atazanavir, Clarithromycin, Indinavir, Itraconazole, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Ketoconazole, Telithromycin) together with this inhaler is of minor clinical relevance, but caution needs to be taken in long-term treatment and co-administration with such drugs should be avoided if possible.\rContraindications\rthis inhaler should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator is required. Patients should be advised to have their medicine to be used for relief in an acute asthma attack available at all times.\r The prophylactic use of this inhaler in exercise-induced asthma has not been studied. For such use, a separate rapid-acting bronchodilator should be considered. Patients should be reminded to take their this inhaler maintenance dose as prescribed, even when asymptomatic. Patients should not be initiated on this inhaler during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhaler. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation on this inhaler.\r This inhaler should not be used as the first treatment for asthma.\r This inhaler should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, quiescent tuberculosis or patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airway. This inhaler should be used with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, aneurysm or other severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias or severe heart failure. Caution must be observed when treating patients with existing prolongation of the QTc interval. Formoterol itself may induce prolongation of the QTc interval.\r As for all ß2 agonists, additional blood sugar controls should be considered in diabetic patients. As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. This inhaler should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary.\r Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained.\rSide Effects\rUndesirable effects which have been associated with this inhaler during clinical development are given in the table below, listed by system organ class. The following frequency categories form the basis for classification of the undesirable effects as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 and <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 and <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 < 1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: There are limited data on the use of Fluticasone Propionate and FormoterolFumarate, either administered alone or together but administered from separate inhalers, or on the use of this fixed-dose combination, this inhaler in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Administration of this inhaler is not recommended during pregnancy, and should only be considered if expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. If this is the case, then the lowest effective dose needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be used.\r Breastfeeding: It is not known whether Fluticasone Propionate or FormoterolFumarateare excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from this inhaler therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\r Fertility: There are no data available on effects on fertility following administration of this inhaler. In animal studies, no effects on fertility have been seen following administration of the individual active substances at clinically relevant doses.\rUse in Special Populations\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients.\r Hepatic or renal: There are no data available for use of this inhaler in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.\r Paediatric population: It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid, if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\r Only limited data are available in respect of the use of this inhaler in children under 12 years of age. This inhaler is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age until further data become available.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no data available from clinical trials on overdose with this inhaler, however, data on overdose with both single drugs are given below:\r FormoterolFumarate: An overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to an exaggeration of effects that are typical for ß2 agonists; in which case the following adverse experiences may occur: angina, hypertension or hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, prolonged QTc interval, headache, tremor, nervousness, muscle cramps, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, malaise, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, nausea and vomiting.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute overdose with Fluticasone Propionate usually does not constitute a clinical problem. The only harmful effect after inhalation of a large amount of the drug over a short period is suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function. HPA axis function usually recovers in a few days, as verified by plasma cortisol measurements. Treatment with the inhaled corticosteroid should be continued at the recommended dose to control asthma.\rTherapeutic Class\rRespiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nAsthma: This fixed-dose combination of Fluticasone Propionate and Formoterol Fumarate is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where the use of a combination product (an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting ß2 agonist) is appropriate:\r\nFor patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and \"as required\" inhaled short-acting ß2 agonist.

Or,\rFor patients already adequately controlled on both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting ß2 agonist.\rFluticasone Propionate 125 mcg and Formoterol Fumarate 5 mcg inhaler are indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above.\r COPD: Fluticasone Propionate and Formoterol Fumarate is recommended when a long-acting ß2 agonist/Inhaled corticosteroid is indicated & patients are unable to use other long-acting ß2 agonist/Inhaled corticosteroid.\r Fluticasone Propionate 125 mcg and Formoterol Fumarate 5 mcg inhaler is indicated in adults only.\rPharmacology\rThis inhaler (a pressurised inhalation, suspension) which contains two active ingredients:\rFluticasone propionate which belongs to a group of medicines called steroids. Steroids help to reduce swelling and inflammation in the lungs.\rFormoterol fumarate dihydrate which belongs to a group of medicines called long-acting beta 2 agonists. Long-acting beta 2 agonists are long-acting bronchodilators which help the airways in your lungs to stay open, making it easier for you to breathe.\rTogether these two active ingredients help to improve your breathing. It is advised that you should use this medicine every day as directed by your doctor or asthma nurse.\r This medicine helps to prevent breathing problems such as asthma and helps to stop you becoming breathless and wheezy. However, it does not work if you are already having an asthma attack i.e. you are already breathless and wheezing. You will need to use a fast acting ‘reliever’ medicine such as salbutamol if this happens.\rDosage\rPatients will need to be trained on the use of the inhaler and their asthma should be regularly reassessed by a doctor, so that the strength of this inhaler they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.\r Patients should be given the strength of this inhaler containing the appropriate Fluticasone Propionate dosage for the severity of their disease.\r Asthma:\rFluticasone Propionate 125 mcg & Formoterol Fumarate 5 mcg inhaler only\rThe recommended dose for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above: Two inhalations (puffs) twice daily normally taken in the morning and in the evening.\rFor adults only: The total daily dose can be further increased if asthma still remains poorly controlled by administering the highest strength of this combination product- i.e. Fluticasone Propionate 250 mcg & Formoterol Fumarate 10 mcg inhaler- two inhalations (puffs) twice daily. This highest strength is for use in adults only; it should not be used in adolescents aged 12 years and above.\rChildren under 12 years: No data are available for this strength of this inhaler in children.\rThis inhaler in any strength is not recommended for use in children less than 12 years of age.\rFluticasone Propionate 250 mcg & Formoterol Fumarate 10 mcg inhaler only\rThe recommended dose for adults: Fluticasone Propionate 250 mcg & Formoterol Fumarate 10 mcg inhaler- two inhalations (puffs) twice daily normally taken in the morning and in the evening.\rAdolescents under 18 years and children: No data are available for this strength of this inhaler in children or adolescents.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo formal drug interaction studies have been performed with this inhaler. Fluticasone Propionate, an individual component of this inhaler, is a substrate of CYP 3A4. The effects of short-term co-administration of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. Ritonavir, Atazanavir, Clarithromycin, Indinavir, Itraconazole, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Ketoconazole, Telithromycin) together with this inhaler is of minor clinical relevance, but caution needs to be taken in long-term treatment and co-administration with such drugs should be avoided if possible.\rContraindications\rthis inhaler should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator is required. Patients should be advised to have their medicine to be used for relief in an acute asthma attack available at all times.\r The prophylactic use of this inhaler in exercise-induced asthma has not been studied. For such use, a separate rapid-acting bronchodilator should be considered. Patients should be reminded to take their this inhaler maintenance dose as prescribed, even when asymptomatic. Patients should not be initiated on this inhaler during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhaler. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation on this inhaler.\r This inhaler should not be used as the first treatment for asthma.\r This inhaler should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, quiescent tuberculosis or patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airway. This inhaler should be used with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, uncorrected hypokalaemia or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, aneurysm or other severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias or severe heart failure. Caution must be observed when treating patients with existing prolongation of the QTc interval. Formoterol itself may induce prolongation of the QTc interval.\r As for all ß2 agonists, additional blood sugar controls should be considered in diabetic patients. As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. This inhaler should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary.\r Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained.\rSide Effects\rUndesirable effects which have been associated with this inhaler during clinical development are given in the table below, listed by system organ class. The following frequency categories form the basis for classification of the undesirable effects as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 and <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 and <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 < 1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: There are limited data on the use of Fluticasone Propionate and FormoterolFumarate, either administered alone or together but administered from separate inhalers, or on the use of this fixed-dose combination, this inhaler in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Administration of this inhaler is not recommended during pregnancy, and should only be considered if expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. If this is the case, then the lowest effective dose needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be used.\r Breastfeeding: It is not known whether Fluticasone Propionate or FormoterolFumarateare excreted in human breast milk. Therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from this inhaler therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.\r Fertility: There are no data available on effects on fertility following administration of this inhaler. In animal studies, no effects on fertility have been seen following administration of the individual active substances at clinically relevant doses.\rUse in Special Populations\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients.\r Hepatic or renal: There are no data available for use of this inhaler in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.\r Paediatric population: It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid, if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\r Only limited data are available in respect of the use of this inhaler in children under 12 years of age. This inhaler is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age until further data become available.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are no data available from clinical trials on overdose with this inhaler, however, data on overdose with both single drugs are given below:\r FormoterolFumarate: An overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to an exaggeration of effects that are typical for ß2 agonists; in which case the following adverse experiences may occur: angina, hypertension or hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, prolonged QTc interval, headache, tremor, nervousness, muscle cramps, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, malaise, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, nausea and vomiting.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute overdose with Fluticasone Propionate usually does not constitute a clinical problem. The only harmful effect after inhalation of a large amount of the drug over a short period is suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function. HPA axis function usually recovers in a few days, as verified by plasma cortisol measurements. Treatment with the inhaled corticosteroid should be continued at the recommended dose to control asthma.\rTherapeutic Class\rRespiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nAsthma: This fixed-dose combination of Fluticasone Propionate and Formoterol Fumarate is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where the use of a combination product (an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting ß2 agonist) is appropriate:\r\nFor patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and \"as required\" inhaled short-acting ß2 agonist.

The pharmacologic efects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5 -adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.\r The precise mechanism through which futicasone furoate afects COPD and asthma symptoms is not known. Infammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of COPD and asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in infammation.\r Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar afnity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological efects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.\rDosage & Administration\rThis inhalation capsule must not be swallowed. Only to be used with the device. Remove the capsule from the blister pack only immediately before using it in the inhalation device. After inhalation, rinse your mouth with water without swallowing to reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.\r Adults (18 years or older): Should be used at the same time every day, not more than once every 24 hours. If shortness of breath or other asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled SABA (Short Acting β-Agonist) should be taken for immediate relief.\r Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation capsule once daily.\r Maintenance treatment of Asthma: 1 inhalation capsule once daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rStrong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Use with caution. May cause systemic corticosteroid and cardiovascular effects.\r Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate the effect of vilanterol on the vascular system.\r Beta-blockers: Use with caution. May block the bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.\r Diuretics: Use with caution. Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non–potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\r Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of Trelanti with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.\rContraindications\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or acute episodes of COPD or asthma requiring intensive measures\rSevere hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients.\rSide Effects\rCOPD: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, oral candidiasis, headache, back pain, arthralgia, infuenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, dysgeusia, constipation, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, cough, and dysphonia.\r Asthma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are pharyngitis/nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection/viral upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, respiratory tract infection/viral respiratory tract infection, sinusitis/acute sinusitis, urinary tract infection, rhinitis, infuenza, headache, and back pain.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rInsufficient data on the use of this preparation in pregnant women and lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.\rDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms.\rDo not use in combination with additional therapy containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.\rCandida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk.\rIncreased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia.\rIf paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue and institute alternative therapy.\rUse with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.\rWorsening of urinary retention may occur.

Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in infammation.\r\n \nUmeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar afnity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 . In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological efects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThis inhalation capsule must not be swallowed. Only to be used with the device. Remove the capsule from the blister pack only immediately before using it in the inhalation device. After inhalation, rinse your mouth with water without swallowing to reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.\r\n \nAdults (18 years or older): Should be used at the same time every day, not more than once every 24 hours. If shortness of breath or other asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled SABA (Short Acting β-Agonist) should be taken for immediate relief.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation capsule once daily.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Asthma: 1 inhalation capsule once daily.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nStrong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Use with caution. May cause systemic corticosteroid and cardiovascular effects.\r\n \nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate the effect of vilanterol on the vascular system.\r\n \nBeta-blockers: Use with caution. May block the bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.\r\n \nDiuretics: Use with caution. Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non–potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\r\n \nAnticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of Trelanti with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.\r\nContraindications\r\nPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or acute episodes of COPD or asthma requiring intensive measures\r\nSevere hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCOPD: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, bronchitis, oral candidiasis, headache, back pain, arthralgia, infuenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, dysgeusia, constipation, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, cough, and dysphonia.\r\n \nAsthma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are pharyngitis/nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection/viral upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, respiratory tract infection/viral respiratory tract infection, sinusitis/acute sinusitis, urinary tract infection, rhinitis, infuenza, headache, and back pain.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nInsufficient data on the use of this preparation in pregnant women and lactating mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.\r\nDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma.

Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder.

Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Ticamet contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Ticamet inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Ticamet inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Ticamet contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Ticamet inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Ticamet inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction.

Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Ticamet contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Ticamet inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Ticamet inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r\n \nSalmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r\n \nFluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\r\nDosage\r\nInhaler:\r\nAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r\nChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r\n \nInhalation capsule (for asthma):\r\nAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \r\nThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \r\nThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\r\nPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\r\nInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r\n \n \nMaxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r\n \nAdults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r\n50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\n50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\n50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\nChildren (4 years and older)-\r\n50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\r\nMaxhaler (For COPD):\r\nInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r\nSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\r\nUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r\n \nFollowing simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\r\nTake off the cap.\r\nShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\r\nIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\r\nBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\r\nPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\r\nWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\r\nRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\r\nIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\r\nAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\r\nCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\r\nInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rSultolin may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSultolin should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Sultolin may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia.

Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Sultolin may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Sultolin is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children..",

At therapeutic doses, it acts on the β2-adrenoceptors of bronchial smooth muscle, with little or no action on the β1-adrenoceptors of cardiac muscle. Salbutamol provides short-acting (4-6 hours) bronchodilatation with a fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction. It also has an anti-inflammatory effect on mast cells causing inhibition of release of bronchoconstrictor mediators including histamine, neutrophil chemotactive factor (NCF) and prostaglandin D2.\rDosage\rAdminister Salbutamol Inhaler by oral inhalation only. Shake Salbutamol Inhaler well before each spray.\r For relief of acute episodes of bronchospasm:\rAdults: 1 or 2 puffs as necessary. The maximum dose is up to 8 puffs in 24 hours.\rChildren: Half the adult dose.\rTo prevent allergen-or exercise-induced bronchospasm:\rAdults: 2 puffs 15 minutes prior to exercise or exposure to the allergen. The maximum dose is 2 puffs, up to 4 times a day.\rChildren: Half the adult dose.\rChronic therapy:\rAdults: Up to 200 mcg (2 puffs) four times daily.\rChildren: Up to 200 mcg (2 puffs) four times daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations).

Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rSultolin is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Sultolin\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salbutamol inhaler or salbutamol sulfate in pregnant women. This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Sultolin sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Sultolin inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Sultolin inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Sultolin inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiograms (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST-segment depression.

        "description": "Indications\rSalbutamol sulfate & Ipratropium bromide solution for inhalation is indicated for the treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with obstructive airway diseases in patients who require more than a single bronchodilator.\rDescription\rThis solution for inhalation contains two active bronchodilating substances Salbutamoi Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide. Salbutamoi Sulphate is a beta2-adrenergic agent which acts on airway smooth muscle resulting in relaxation. Salbutamoi relaxes all smooth muscle from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles and protects against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Ipratropium Bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound with anticholinergic properties. In preclinical studies, it appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonising the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increase of intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium Bromide is primarily local and site specific to the lung and non systemic in nature. This provides simultaneous release of Ipratropium Bromide and Salbutamoi allowing synergistic efficacy on the muscarinic and beta2 adrenergic receptors in the airways to cause bronchodilation which is superior to that provided by each single agent and with no potentiation of adverse events.\rPharmacology\rIpratropium Bromide is quickly absorbed after inhalation. The systemic bioavailability following inhalation is estimated to be less than 10% of the dose. Renal excretion of Ipratropium Bromide is given as 46% of the dose after intravenous administration. The half-life of the terminal elimination phase is about 1.6 hours as determined after intravenous administration. Elimination half-life of drug and metabolites is 3.6 hours as determined after radio labelling. Ipratropium Bromide does not penetrate the blood brain barrier.\r Salbutamoi Sulphate is rapidly and completely absorbed following administration either by inhaled or oral route. Peak plasma Salbutamoi concentrations are seen within three hours of administration and it is excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours. The elimination half-life is 4 hours. Salbutamoi will cross the blood brain barrier reaching concentrations amounting to about five percent of the plasma concentrations.\r It has been shown that co-nebulisation of Ipratropium Bromide and Salbutamoi Sulphate does not potentiate the systemic absorption of either component and that therefore the additive activity of this solution is due to the combined local effect on the lung following inhalation.\rDosage\rSalbutamol sulfate & Ipratropium bromide solution for inhalation in ampoule may be administered from a suitable nebulizer or an intermittent positive pressure ventilator.\rAdults (including elderly): Use one 3 ml ampoule in the nebulizer four times a day. Two additional treatments may be used per day, if needed.\rChildren: Use and dose must be determined by doctor.\rPatients should be advised to consult a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately in the case of acute or rapidly worsening dyspnoea if additional inhalations do not produce an adequate improvement.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rStep 1: Twist off the top of the ampoule. Be careful to hold the ampoule upright.\rStep 2: Squeeze the desired amount of the nebulizer solution into the nebulizer chamber.\rStep 3: If dilution is needed follow the physician’s direction.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThe concurrent administration of other beta-mimetics, systemically absorbed anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives may increase the side effects.\r Beta-agonist induced hypokalaemia may be increased by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, glucocorticosteroids and diuretics. This should be taken into account particularly in patients with severe airway obstruction.\r Hypokalaemia may result in an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients receiving digoxin. It is recommended that serum potassium levels be monitored in such situations.\r A potentially serious reduction in bronchodilator effect may occur during concurrent administration of beta-blockers.\r Beta-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta adrenergic agonists may be enhanced.\r Inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbon anaesthetics such as halothane, trichloroethylene and enflurane may increase the susceptibility to the cardiovascular effects of beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with hypertrophic obstructive tachyarrhythmia and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atropine or its derivatives, or to any other component of the product.\rSide Effects\rIn common with other beta-agonists containing products, side effects of this solution can include fine tremor of skeletal muscles and nervousness and less frequently tachycardia, dizziness, palpitations or headache, especially in hypersensitive patients.\r Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from prolonged and/or high dose beta2 agonist therapy.\r As with use of other inhalation therapy, cough, local irritation and less commonly inhalation induced bronchospasm can occur. As with other beta-mimetics, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness and myalgia/muscle cramps may occur. In rare cases decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase in systolic blood pressure, arrhythmias, particularly after higher doses, may occur.\r In individual cases psychological alterations have been reported under inhalation therapy with beta-mimetics.\r The most frequent non-respiratory anticholinergic related adverse events are dryness of mouth and dysphonia. There have been isolated reports of ocular complications (i.e. mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, angle closure glaucoma, and eye pain) when aerosolised ipratropium bromide either alone or in combination with adrenergic beta2 agonist, has escaped into the eyes. Ocular side effects, gastrointestinal motility disturbances and urinary retention may occur in rare cases and are reversible.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Animal studies with Salbutamoi Sulphate have demonstrated a teratogenic effect. It is not known whether this medication is harmful to the fetus. No evidence of abnormalities has been reported in women receiving albuterol during pregnancy. This solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies. This solution should be used with caution before childbirth in view of Salbutamol's inhibitory effects on uterine contractions.\r Salbutamol Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide are probably excreted in breast milk and their effects on neonates are not known. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that this will happen to any extent especially when taken by inhalation. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when This solution is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIn the case of acute, rapidly worsening dyspnoea a doctor should be consulted immediately. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of this solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm and oropharyngeal oedema.\rOverdose Effects\rThe effects of overdosage are expected to be primarily related to Salbutamol because acute overdosage with Ipratropium Bromide is unlikely as it is not well absorbed systemically after inhalation or oral administration.\r Symptoms: Manifestations of overdosage with salbutamol may include tachycardia, anginal pain, hypertension, hypotension , palpitations, tremor, widening of the pulse pressure, arrhythmia and flushing.\r Therapy: Administration of sedatives, tranquillisers; in severe cases, intensive therapy. Beta-receptor blockers, preferably beta1-selective, are suitable as specific antidotes; however, a possible increase in bronchial obstruction must be taken into account and the dose should be adjusted carefully in patients suffering from bronchial asthma.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined bronchodilators\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when This solution is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIn the case of acute, rapidly worsening dyspnoea a doctor should be consulted immediately. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of this solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm and oropharyngeal oedema.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe effects of overdosage are expected to be primarily related to Salbutamol because acute overdosage with Ipratropium Bromide is unlikely as it is not well absorbed systemically after inhalation or oral administration.\r\n \nSymptoms: Manifestations of overdosage with salbutamol may include tachycardia, anginal pain, hypertension, hypotension , palpitations, tremor, widening of the pulse pressure, arrhythmia and flushing.\r\n \nTherapy: Administration of sedatives, tranquillisers; in severe cases, intensive therapy. Beta-receptor blockers, preferably beta1-selective, are suitable as specific antidotes; however, a possible increase in bronchial obstruction must be taken into account and the dose should be adjusted carefully in patients suffering from bronchial asthma.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined bronchodilators\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nPack Image of Pack Image: Sulprex (2.5 mg Respirator Solution (3 ml ampoule)\r\n",

        "description": "Indications\rThis inhalation aerosol is indicated for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a regular aerosol bronchodilator who continues to have evidence of bronchospasm and who requires a second bronchodilator.\rPharmacology\rThis inhalation aerosol is a combination of Salbutamol (as Sulphate) and Ipratropium Bromide. It is a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) based environment friendly inhaler. Because it does not contain chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as propellant which is one of the main reasons of ozone layer depletion.\r Salbutamol is a short acting beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator and Ipratropium Bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. When used in combination, Ipratropium Bromide prevents the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle. This inhalation aerosol is expected to maximize the response of the treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms, anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) and sympathomimetic. Simultaneous administration of an anticholinergic (Ipratropium Bromide) and a beta 2-sympathomimetic (Salbutamol) is designed to benefit the patient by producing a greater bronchodilatory effect than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage.\rDosage\rAdult dose (Including the elderly): 2 puffs of Salpium 4 times a day (Patients may take additional puffs as required but a total number of puffs should not exceed 12 in 24 hours). Or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThis inhalation aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines and steroids, commonly used in the treatment of COPD. No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with this inhalation aerosol and these or other medications commonly used in the treatment of COPD. Ipratropium Bromide should be co-administered cautiously with other anticholinergic agents and sympathomimetic agents, which may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Beta-2-agonist containing drugs, like this inhalation aerosol, should be administrated with extreme caution in patients with non-potassium sparing diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.\rContraindications\rThis inhalation aerosol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Soya-Lecithin or related food products such as soybean and peanut. This inhalation aerosol is also contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any other components of the drug product or to atropine or its derivatives.\rSide Effects\rDue to presence of Salbutamol, mild tremor and headache have been reported. These usually disappear with continuous treatment. There have been very rare reports of treatments muscle cramp, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm and hypotension.\r For the presence of Ipratropium Bromide headache, influenza, chest pain, nausea, dyspnea, coughing, pharyngitis, sinusitis are rarely reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIpratropium Bromide: Pregnancy category B. Studies have demonstrated no teratogenic effects as a result of ipratropium.\r Salbutamol: Pregnancy category C. Salbutamol has been shown to be teratogenic in animals.\r There are, however no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salpium Inhalation Aerosol (Salbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide combination) in pregnant woman.

Vitis vinifera is the principal herb of Revatol belongs to Vitaceae family is a perennial woody vine native to Asia and then introduced in Europe and other continents. It is familiar as grapes or Drakkha in Bangladesh.\r Chemical constituents: The chemical analysis has shown the presence of proanthocyanidins (PCOs) including procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavanoids. 3-oxo-a-ionol, vomifoliol and dehydrovomifoliol were identified for the first time in fruit from Vitis vinifera. Therapeutically active constituent, resveratrol is isolated from the skin of Grapes.\rPharmacology\rGrapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called \"proanthocyanidins\" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase.\r Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias.

Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)\rDosage & Administration\rMahadrakkharist content of grapes is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect. The Daily recommended dose of resveratrol is 8 mg/kg body weight. Each 5 ml syrup contains 36 mg resveratrol as a fluid extract. So the daily recommended dose is-\rChildren under 12 years: 1-2 teaspoonfuls (5-10 ml) 2 times daily after meal.\rAbove 12 years and Adult: 3-4 teaspoonfuls (15-20 ml) 2 times daily after meal for 4-8 weeks or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIt should be used cautiously in patients taking anticoagulants such as warfarin, aspirin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), ACE inhibitors or anti-platelet agents. Based on animal studies, grape seed may increase the risk of bleeding. PCOs may theoretically alter the effectiveness of prescribed blood pressure medications that are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\rSide Effects\rThere are no side effects associated with the use of Drakkha in the above-mentioned therapeutic doses. Drakkha has been used safely as an ayurvedic medicine for hundreds of years.

Vitis vinifera is the principal herb of Revatol belongs to Vitaceae family is a perennial woody vine native to Asia and then introduced in Europe and other continents. It is familiar as grapes or Drakkha in Bangladesh.\r\n \nChemical constituents: The chemical analysis has shown the presence of proanthocyanidins (PCOs) including procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavanoids. 3-oxo-a-ionol, vomifoliol and dehydrovomifoliol were identified for the first time in fruit from Vitis vinifera. Therapeutically active constituent, resveratrol is isolated from the skin of Grapes.\r\nPharmacology\r\nGrapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called \"proanthocyanidins\" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase.\r\n \nResveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMontene has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montene did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montene was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montene approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montene. No dosage adjustment for Montene is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montene.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontene is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montene can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montene should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montene should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montene. Although Montene is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montene and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Maintenance doses in most conditions are within the range of 3-18 mg/day.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The maintenance dose is usually within the range of 3-18 mg/day. The smallest effective dose should be used and increased if necessary.\rBronchial asthma: In the treatment of an acute attack, high doses of 48-72 mg/day may be needed depending on severity and gradually reduced once the attack has been controlled. For maintenance in chronic asthma, doses should be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms.\rOther conditions: The dose of Deflazacort depends on clinical need titrated to the lowest effective dose for maintenance. Starting doses may be estimated on the basis of ratio of 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone to 6 mg.\rChildren: There has been limited exposure of children to Deflazacort in clinical trials. In children, the indications for glucocorticoids arethe same as for adults, but it is important that the lowest effective dosage is used. Alternate day administration may be appropriate. Doses of Deflazacort usually lie in the range 0.25-1.5 mg/kg/day.\r The following ranges provide general guidance:\rJuvenile chronic arthritis: The usual maintenance dose is between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day.\rNephrotic syndrome: Initial dose of usually 1.5 mg/kg/day followed by down titration according to clinical need.\rBronchial asthma: On the basis of the potency ratio, the initial dose should be between 0.25-1.0 mg/kg on alternate days.\rDeflazacort withdrawal: In patients who have received more than physiological doses of systemic corticosteroids (approximately 9 mg per day or equivalent) for greater than 3 weeks, withdrawal should not be abrupt.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations.

Special care is necessary in patients with active or quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSystemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, and adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, and glaucoma.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth retardation.\r\n \nThe use of beclometasone dipropionate in mothers breast feeding their babies requires that the therapeutic benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and baby.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients should be instructed in the proper use of the inhaler, and their technique checked, to ensure that the drug reaches the target areas within the lungs. They should also be made aware that Beclometasone Inhaler has to be used regularly, every day, even when they are asymptomatic, for optimum benefit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nRespiratory corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nThe Inhaler should be stored below 30° C, protected from direct sunlight and heat. The canister should not be broken, punctured or burnt, even when apparently empty. Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children.",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Lumenta did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Lumenta was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Lumenta approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Lumenta. No dosage adjustment for Lumenta is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Lumenta.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLumenta is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Lumenta can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Lumenta should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Lumenta should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Lumenta. Although Lumenta is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Lumenta and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

It contains much more vitamins than a typical synthetic vitam in or any vegetarian meal. It also has essential and non-essential amino acids that are ten times more than meat. It also has a high supply of carotenoids such as beta carotene and yellow xanthophylls which have antioxidant properties. It is also rich in Chlorophyll, fatty and nucleic acids and lipids.\rPharmacology\rSpirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate.\r How does it work-\rAbout 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.\rEvery 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.\rSpirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.\rAnother health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.\rDosage & Administration\r2 to 4 capsules daily or as advised by the physician.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere are no reports suggesting that Pirulin interacts with any conventional medication.\rContraindications\rSpirulina is contraindicated in those who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rPirulin is generally well tolerated.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rOdmon has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Odmon did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Odmon was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Odmon approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Odmon. No dosage adjustment for Odmon is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Odmon.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOdmon is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Odmon can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Odmon should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Odmon should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Odmon. Although Odmon is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Odmon and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montekast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montekast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montekast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montekast. No dosage adjustment for Montekast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montekast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontekast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montekast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montekast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montekast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montekast. Although Montekast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montekast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rMontiva is indicated for:\rProphylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma\rAcute prevention of Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)\rRelief of symptoms of Allergic Rhinitis (AR): Seasonal & Perennial Allergic Rhinitis\rReversair - MedEx campaign banner\rMonas - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rMontelukast is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT1). The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMontiva has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montiva did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montiva was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montiva approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montiva. No dosage adjustment for Montiva is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montiva.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontiva is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montiva can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montiva should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montiva should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montiva. Although Montiva is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montiva and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMontiva has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montiva did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montiva was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montiva approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montiva. No dosage adjustment for Montiva is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montiva.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMontiva is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montiva can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montiva should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montiva should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montiva. Although Montiva is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montiva and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC35H36ClNO3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Montelukast Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Montiva 10 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Montiva 10 mg Tablet?\r\nMontiva 10 mg Tablet is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist.\r\nWhat is Montiva 10 mg Tablet used for?\r\nMontiva 10 mg Tablet is commonly used to treat asthma or allergic rhinitis.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montair ODT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montair ODT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montair ODT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montair ODT. No dosage adjustment for Montair ODT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montair ODT.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontair ODT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montair ODT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montair ODT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montair ODT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montair ODT. Although Montair ODT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montair ODT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma (\r\nsuch as, airway edema, smooth muscle contraction and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which\r\ncontribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma).\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nMontelukast is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients from 6 months of age\r\nand older.\r\n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \nAdults (15 years of age or over): 10 mg daily to be taken in the evening.\r\nChildren (6-14 years of age): 5 mg daily to be taken in the evening.\r\nChildren (6 months-5 years of age): 4 mg daily to be taken in the evening.\r\nSafety and effectiveness of Montelukast in pediatric patients younger than two years of age have not been established.\r\nThe safety and efficacy of Montelukast was demonstrated in clinical trials where it was administered in the evening without regard\r\nto the time of food ingestion.\r\n \n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nGenerally, Montelukast is well-tolerated. Side effects include dizziness, headache, diarrhea, restlessness, abdominal pain, cough,\r\nfever, asthenia, rash and upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nMontelukast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks (in case of status asthmaticus).\r\nPatients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or other NSAID, while taking Montelukast.\r\nIn rare cases, patients on therapy with Montelukast may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical\r\nfeatures of vasculitis consistent with churg-strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid\r\ntherapy. Physician should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or\r\nneuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between Montelukast and these underlying conditions has not been\r\nestablished.\r\n \n \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r\n \nPregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Montelukast in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies\r\nare not always predictive of human response, so Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\r\nLactation: It is not known if Montelukast is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, so caution\r\nshould be exercised when Montelukast is given to a nursing mother.\r\n \n \nDRUG INTERACTION\r\n \nMontelukast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no\r\nappropriate increase in adverse reactions.\r\nCytochrome P-450 inducers: Although Phenobarbital induces hepatic metabolism, no dosage adjustment for Montelukast is recommended.\r\nIt is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P-450 enzyme inducers, such as Phenobarbital or\r\nRifampin, are co-administered with Montelukast.\r\n \n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nThere were no adverse experiences reported in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequent adverse experiences observed\r\nwere thirst, mydriasis, hyperkinesia, and abdominal pain. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual\r\nsupportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute\r\nsupportive therapy, if required.\r\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nMontair 4 : Each box contains 3 Alu-Alu blister strip of 10 chewable tablets.\r\nMontair 5 : Each box contains 3 Alu-Alu blister strip of 10 chewable tablets.\r\nMontair 10 : Each box contains 3 Alu-Alu blister strip of 10 tablets.\r\nMontairTM 4 ODT : Each box contains 3 Alu-Alu blister strips of 10 Orodispersible tablets.\r\nMontairTM 5 ODT : Each box contains 3 Alu-Alu blister strips of 10 Orodispersible tablets",

        "description": "Indications\rConsucon MR is a medicine that reduces blood sugar levels (oral antidiabetic medicine belonging to the sulphonylurea group). Consucon MR is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.\rPharmacology\rGliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca+2  transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet: The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes.\r Modified release preparation: Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses.\r The recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s).\r If a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.\r If you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should: If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency.\r If you forget to take Gliclazide tablet: It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\r If you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet: As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rOther medicines and Consucon MR: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\r The blood sugar lowering effect of Consucon MR may be strengthened and signs of low blood sugar levels may occur when one of the follow ng medicines is taken:\rother medicines used to treat high blood sugar (oral antidiabetics, GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin),\rantibiotics (sulphonamides, clarithromycin)\rmedicines to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (beta-blockers. ACE-inhibitors such as captopril, or enalapril)\rmedicines to treat fungal infections (miconazole, fluconazole)\rmedicines to treat ulcers in the stomach or duodenum (H2 receptor antagonists),\rmedicines to treat depression (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)\rpainkiller or antirheumatics (phenylbutazone, ibuprofen)\rmedicines containing alcohol\rThe blood-glucose-lowering effect of Consucon MR may be weakened and raised blood sugar levels may occur when one of the following medicines is taken:\rmedicines to treat disorders of the central nervous system (chlorpromazine)\rmedicines reducing inflammation (corticosteroids)\rmedicines to treat asthma or used during labour (intravenous salbutamol, ritodrine and terbutaline)\rmedicines to treat breast disorders, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis (danazol)\rSt John's Wort- Hypericum perforatum- preparations\rBlood glucose disturbance (low blood sugar and high blood sugar) can occur when a medicine belonging to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones is taken at the same time as Consucon MR especially in elderly patients.\r Consucon MR may increase the effects of medicines that reduce blood clotting (warfarin).\r Consult your doctor before you start taking another medicinal product. If you go into hospital tell the medical staff you are taking Consucon MR.\r Consucon MR with food and drink: Consucon MR can be taken with food and non-alcoholic drinks. Drinking alcohol is not recommended as it can alter the control of your diabetes in an unpredictable manner.\r Driving and using machines: Your ability to concentrate or react may be impaired if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), or too high (hyperglycaemia) or if you develop visual problems as a result of such conditions. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others (for instance when driving a car or using machines). Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car if you:\rhave frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\rhave few or no warning signals of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\rConsucon MR contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\rContraindications\rDo not take Gliclazide:\rif you are allergic to gliclazide or to other medicines of the same group (sulfonylurea), or to other related medicines (hypoglycaemic sulfonamides)\rif you have insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1)\rif you have ketone bodies and sugar in your urine (this may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis), a diabetic pre-coma or coma\rif you have severe kidney or liver disease\rif you are taking medicines to treat fungal infections\rif you are breastfeeding\rSide Effects\rLike all medicines, Consucon MR can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention.\r Liver disorders: There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment.\r Skin disorders: Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported.

You must not take Gliclazide while you are breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTalk to your doctor before taking Consucon MR. You should observe the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to achieve proper blood sugar levels. This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Consucon MR treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary.\r Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur:\rif you take meals irregularly or skip meals altogether,\rif you are fasting\rif you are malnourished\rif you change your diet\rif you increase your physical activity and carbohydrate intake does not match this increase,\rif you drink alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals,\rif you take other medicines or natural remedies at the same time,\rif you take too high doses of Consucon MR,\rif you suffer from particular hormone-induced disorders (functional disorders of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland or adrenal cortex),\rif your kidney function or liver function is severely decreased.\rif you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness.\r The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris).\r If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious.\r In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea).\r You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur.\r Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped.

It works by supporting your body in controlling blood sugar levels in two ways. First, it encourages your pancreas to release more insulin. Second, it improves your body's ability to use the insulin it already has. Thus it lowers your blood sugar levels.\rWhat happens if I take Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet without eating?\rConsucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet dosage is tied to your meals. It should be skipped if you miss a meal. If you plan to eat an extra meal, talk to your doctor about adjusting your dose for that day.\rWhat if I missed a dose of Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet?\rThe missed dose can be taken as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Do not take two doses together to make up for a missed dose.\rHow long does the effect of Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet last?\rThe effect of this medicine lasts for an average duration of 24 hours.\rAre there any pregnancy warnings for Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet?\rThis medicine is not recommended for pregnant women.\rGeneral Instructions\rTake Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet as directed by your doctor. This includes the dose and how often you should take it.\rThe medicine should be taken by mouth (orally) 30 minutes before breakfast.\rYou should monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as directed by your doctor.\rAlways carry a sugary candy with you to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Consistent food intake reduces the risk of hypoglycemia.\nIndications\r\nConsucon MR is a medicine that reduces blood sugar levels (oral antidiabetic medicine belonging to the sulphonylurea group). Consucon MR is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.\r\nPharmacology\r\nGliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca+2  transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated tablet: The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes.\r\n \nModified release preparation: Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses.\r\n \nThe recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s).\r\n \nIf a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.\r\n \nIf you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should: If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency.\r\n \nIf you forget to take Gliclazide tablet: It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\r\n \nIf you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet: As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther medicines and Consucon MR: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\r\n \nThe blood sugar lowering effect of Consucon MR may be strengthened and signs of low blood sugar levels may occur when one of the follow ng medicines is taken:\r\nother medicines used to treat high blood sugar (oral antidiabetics, GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin),\r\nantibiotics (sulphonamides, clarithromycin)\r\nmedicines to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (beta-blockers.

Deflazacort is a\rglucocorticoid and 6mg of Deflazacort has approximately the same anti-in¬flammatory potency as 5mg Prednisolone or prednisone.\rDeflazacort works by acting within cells to prevent the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system.\rThese chemicals are normally involved in producing immune and allergic responses, resulting in inflammation. Deflazacort also\rdecreases the numbers of white blood cells circulating in the blood. This, along with the decrease in inflammatory chemicals, can\rprevent the rejection of organ transplants, as it prevents the body from attacking foreign tissue. It is useful for the treatment\rof certain types of leukaemia, where there is an abnormally large production of certain white blood cells, and for treating\rcertain diseases that are caused by the immune system attacking tissues in the body (autoimmune diseases).\r  INDICATIONS\r • Severe allergic reactions, e.g anaphylaxis\r • Asthma\r • Rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica\r • Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn\\'s disease and ulcerative colitis\r • Inflammatory disorders of the kidney, such as nephrotic syndrome and interstitial nephritis\r • Inflammatory eye disorders, eg uveitis, optic neuritis\r • Inflammatory skin disorders, including pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid and pyoderma gangrenosum\r • Inflammatory disease of the skin and muscles (dermatomyositis)\r • Systemic lupus erythematosus\r • Mixed connective tissue disease\r • Rare condition involving inflammation in the walls of arteries (polyarteritis nodosa)\r • Sarcoidosis\r • Rheumatic carditis\r • Cancer of the bone marrow (multiple myeloma)\r • Acute and lymphatic leukaemia\r • Cancer of the lymph nodes (lymphoma)\r • Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura\r • Anaemia caused by the immune system attacking red blood cells (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia)\r • Helping to prevent the immune system attacking a transplanted organ, eg heart, liver, kidney etc.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Adults: Usual maintenance 3-18 mg daily (acute disorders, initially up to 120 mg daily).\rChild 1 month–11 years: 0.25–1.5 mg/kg daily or on alternate days; up to 2.4 mg/kg (max.120 mg) daily in emergency situations.\rChild 12–17 years: 3–18 mg daily or on alternate days; up to 2.4 mg/kg (max. 120 mg) daily in emergency situations.\r When Deflazacort is used for long term, the maintenance dose should be kept as low as possible. Dosage may need to be increased\rduring exacerbation of illness. It should not stop taking this medicine suddenly if it has been taking for more than three weeks.\rThis is because long-term use of corticosteroids can suppress the natural production of corticosteroids by the adrenal glands,\rwhich means that the body becomes temporarily reliant on the medicine. When it is time to stop treatment the dose should be\rtapered down gradually, to allow the adrenal glands to start producing adequate amounts of natural steroids again.\r Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment, blood levels of Deflazacort may be increased. Therefore the dose of\rDeflazacort should be carefully monitored and adjusted to the minimum effective dose.\r Renal Impairment: In renally impaired patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving\rglucocorticoid therapy are necessary.\r Elderly: In elderly patients, no special precautions other than those usually adopted in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy\rare necessary.\r    SIDE EFFECTS\r Psychological problems, weight gain, GI disturbances, musculoskeletal, endocrine, ophthalmic, fluid and electrolyte disturbance,\rsusceptible to infection, impaired healing, hypersensitivity, bone fractures, osteoporosis, edema, peptic ulcer, Cushing\\'s\rsyndrome, skin atrophy, striae, menstrual disturbances, telangiectasia, acne, myocardial rupture following recent myocardial\rinfarction, thromboembolism.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r The following clinical conditions require special caution and frequent patient monitoring is necessary-\rAdrenal suppression and infection, child, adolescents, elderly, history of TB and steroid myopathy, hypertension, recent\rmyocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, liver failure, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus and glaucoma (including family\rhistory), osteoporosis, corneal perforation, epilepsy, peptic ulcer, hypothyroidism, pregnancy and lactation.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy: Deflazacort does cross the placenta. However, when administered for prolonged periods or repeatedly during pregnancy,\rcorticosteroids may increase the risk of intra-uterine growth retardation.\rAs with all drugs, corticosteroids should only be prescribed when the benefits to the mother and child outweigh the risks.\r Nursing Mother: Corticosteroids are excreted in breast milk, although no data are available for Deflazacort. Doses of up to 50 mg\rdaily of Deflazacort are unlikely to cause systemic effects in the infant. Infants of mothers taking higher doses than this may\rhave a degree of adrenal suppression but the benefits of breast feeding are likely to outweigh any theoretical risk.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r The following medicines may interact with Deflazacort-\r Antacids, ACE inhibitors, acetazolamide, adrenergic neuron blockers, antidiabetics, aspirin, barbiturate, ß-blockers,\rcalcium-channel blockers, carbamazepine, carbenoxolone, cardiac glycosides, clonidine, coumarins, diazoxide, diuretics,\rerythromycin, hydralazine, ketoconazole, methotrexate, methyldopa, mifepristone, minoxidil, moxonidine, nitrates, nitroprusside,\rNSAIDs, oestrogens, phenytoin, primidone, rifamycins, ritonavir, somatropin, ß2 sympathomimetics, theophylline, vaccines.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Deflazit 6 Tablet: Each box contains 3 Alu-PVC blister strips of 10 tablets.\rDeflazit 24 Tablet: Each box contains 2 Alu-PVC blister strips of 10 tablets.\rDeflazit 50 ml Suspension: Each bottle contains 50 ml Deflazacort Suspension\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nDeflazit 6 Tablet: Each tablet contains Deflazacort INN 6 mg.\r\n \nDeflazit 24 Tablet: Each tablet contains Deflazacort INN 24 mg\r\n \nDeflazit 50 ml Suspension: Each 5 ml Suspension contains Deflazacort INN 6 mg\r\n \n \n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nDeflazacort is an oxazoline derivative of prednisolone with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity.

Besides Deflazacort decreases the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system. By decreasing the release of these chemicals Deflazacort provides immunosuppressive action.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults-\rFor acute disorders: Up to 120 mg/day Deflazacort may need to be given initially. Maintenance doses in most conditions are within the range of 3-18 mg/day.\rRheumatoid arthritis: The maintenance dose is usually within the range of 3-18 mg/day. The smallest effective dose should be used and increased if necessary.\rBronchial asthma: In the treatment of an acute attack, high doses of 48-72 mg/day may be needed depending on severity and gradually reduced once the attack has been controlled. For maintenance in chronic asthma, doses should be titrated to the lowest dose that controls symptoms.\rOther conditions: The dose of Deflazacort depends on clinical need titrated to the lowest effective dose for maintenance. Starting doses may be estimated on the basis of ratio of 5 mg prednisone or prednisolone to 6 mg.\rChildren: There has been limited exposure of children to Deflazacort in clinical trials.

It inhibits edema, inflammation, capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen.\rTherefore, swelling and pain of inflammatory conditions is decreased.\r  INDICATIONS\r Allergy and anaphylaxis: Bronchial asthma, drug hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, angioneurotic oedema, anaphylaxis.\r Respiratory disease: Allergic pheumonitis, asthma, occupational asthma, pulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary\ralveolitis, aspiration of foreign body, aspiration of stomach contents, pulmonary sarcoid, drug induced lung disease, adult\rrespiratory distress syndrome, spasmodic croup.\r Rheumatic disorders: Rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, juvenile chronic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,\rdermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease.\r Arteritis/collagenosis: Giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica, mixed connective tissue disease, polyarteritis nodosa,\rpolymyositis.\r Blood disorders: Haemolytic anaemia (autoimmune), leukaemia (acute and lymphocytic), lymphoma, multiple myeloma, idiopathic\rthrombocytopenic purpura.\r Cardiovascular disorders: Post myocardial infarction syndrome, rheumatic fever with severe carditis.\r Endocrine disorders: Primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r Gastro-intestinal disorders: Crohn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s disease, ulcerative colitis, persistent celiac syndrome, autoimmune chronic\ractive hepatitis, multisystem disease affecting liver, biliary peritonitis.\r Infections: Miliary tuberculosis, mumps orchitis (adult), tuberculous meningitis, rickettsial disease.\r Muscular disorders: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis.\r Neurological disorders: Infantile spasms, ShyDrager syndrome, sub-acute demyelinating polyneuropathy.\r Ocular disease: Sclertis, posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, pseudo tumours of the orbit, malignant ophthalmic Graves disease.\r Renal disorders: Lupus nephritis, acute intersititial nephritis, minimal change glomerulonephritis.\r Skin disorders: Pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, pyoderma gangrenosum.\r Miscellaneous: Sarcoidosis, hyperpyrexia, Behcets disease, immunosuppression in organ transplantation.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r The initial dosage of Cortan may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg daily depending on the disorder being treated. Divided daily dosage is\rusually used.\r The appropriate individual dose must be determined by trial and error and must be re-evaluated regularly according to activity of\rthe disease.\r In general, initial dosage shall be maintained or adjusted until the anticipated response is observed. The dose should be\rgradually reduced until the lowest dose, which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.\r During prolonged therapy, dosage may need to be temporarily increased during periods of stress or during exacerbations of the\rdisease. When the drug is to be stopped, it must be withdrawn gradually and not abruptly.\r Intermittent dosage regimen: A single dose of Cortan in the morning on alternate days or at longer intervals is acceptable therapy\rfor some patients. When this regimen is practical, the degree of pituitary-adrenal suppression can be minimized.\rUse in children\rCorticosteroids cause growth retardation in infancy, childhood and adolescence, which may be irreversible. Treatment should be\radministered where possible as a single dose on alternate days.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r General side-effects include leucocytosis, hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis, thromboembolism, nausea, and malaise.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Caution is necessary when oral corticosteroids, including Prednisolone, are prescribed in patients with the following conditions\rlike-Tuberculosis, Hypertension, Congestive heart failure, Liver failure, Renal insufficiency, Diabetes mellitus or in those with\ra family history of diabetes, Osteoporosis, Patients with a history of severe affective disorders and particularly those with a\rprevious history of steroid-induced psychoses, Epilepsy, Peptic ulceration, Previous Steroid Myopathy.\r Undesirable effects may be minimized by using the lowest effective dose for the minimum period and by administering the daily\rrequirement as a single morning dose on alternate days. Frequent patient review is required to titrate the dose appropriately\ragainst disease activity.\r   USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Use in pregnancy: There is evidence of harmful effects on pregnancy in animals.\rUse in lactation: Corticosteroids are excreted in small amounts in breast milk and infants of mothers taking pharmacological doses\rof steroids should be monitored carefully for signs of adrenal suppression.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducers: Drugs which can cause liver enzyme induction such as phenobarbitone, phenytoin, rifampicin,\rrifabutin, carbamazepine, primidone and aminoglutethimide may reduce the therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids by increasing the\rrate of metabolism.\r Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Concomitant administration of ulcerogenic drugs such as indomethacin during corticosteroid\rtherapy may increase the risk of Gl ulceration.\r Anticoagulants: Response to anticoagulants may be reduced or, less often, enhanced by corticosteroids.\r Vaccines: Live vaccines should not be given to individuals with impaired immune responsiveness. The antibody response to other\rvaccines may be diminished.\r Oestrogens: Oestrogens may potentiate the effects of glucocorticoids and dosage adjustment may be required if oestrogens are added\rto or withdrawn from a stable dosage regimen.\r Other: The desired effects of hypoglycaemic agents (including insulin), anti-hypertensives and diuretics are antagonised by\rcorticosteroids and the hypokalaemic effect of acetazolamide, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics and carbenoxolone are enhanced.\r  OVER DOSE\r Report of acute toxicity and/or death following overdose of glucocorticoids are rare.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Aeron did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Aeron was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Aeron approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Aeron. No dosage adjustment for Aeron is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Aeron.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAeron is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Aeron can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Aeron should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Aeron should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Aeron. Although Aeron is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Aeron and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Aeron.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAeron is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Aeron can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Aeron should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Aeron should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Aeron. Although Aeron is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Aeron and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture. Keep out of reach of children.\r\nChemical Structure\r\nMolecular Formula :\tC35H36ClNO3S\r\nChemical Structure :\tChemical Structure of Montelukast Sodium\r\nCommon Questions about Aeron 10 mg Tablet\r\nWhat is Aeron 10 mg Tablet?\r\nAeron 10 mg Tablet is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist.\r\nWhat is Aeron 10 mg Tablet used for?\r\nAeron 10 mg Tablet is commonly used to treat asthma or allergic rhinitis.

No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAeron FT has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Aeron FT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Aeron FT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Aeron FT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Aeron FT. No dosage adjustment for Aeron FT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Aeron FT.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAeron FT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Aeron FT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Aeron FT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Aeron FT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Aeron FT. Although Aeron FT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Aeron FT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

It helps keep airways open and easy breathing by blocking leukotrienes.\r\nHow soon can the effect of Aeron FT 4 mg DT be observed?\r\nThe effect of Aeron FT 4 mg DT can be observed after 1-3 hours of administration. Aeron FT 4 mg DT is not a fast-acting rescue medicine for asthma attacks and needs to be taken daily to work properly.\r\nHow long does the effect of Aeron FT 4 mg DT last?\r\nThe effect of Aeron FT 4 mg DT lasts for an average duration of 24 hours.\r\nShould I use Aeron FT 4 mg DT empty stomach?\r\nAeron FT 4 mg DT may be taken with or without food as prescribed by your doctor.\r\nWhat if I miss a dose of Aeron FT 4 mg DT?\r\nIf you miss a dose, you may take it as soon as possible. But if it is almost time for your next dose, just skip that dose. Do not double up on doses.\r\nAre there any pregnancy warnings for Aeron FT 4 mg DT?\r\nUse of Aeron FT 4 mg DT in pregnant women should be avoided unless clearly needed.\r\nGeneral Instructions\r\nTake Aeron FT 4 mg DT exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\r\nDo not change your Aeron FT 4 mg DT dose or stop using asthma medication without your doctor's advice.\r\nAeron FT 4 mg DT is not a fast-acting rescue medicine for asthma attacks. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your medications are not working.\r\nAvoid situations or activities that may trigger an asthma attack.\r\nTalk to your doctor before using Aeron FT 4 mg DT if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of M-Kast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, M-Kast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of M-Kast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of M-Kast. No dosage adjustment for M-Kast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with M-Kast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rM-Kast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with M-Kast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, M-Kast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. M-Kast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking M-Kast. Although M-Kast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of M-Kast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDoxoma should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Doxoma together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r\n \nFormoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\r\nDosage\r\nInhaler (For Asthma)-\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\r\nChildren (4 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r\n200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r\n400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r\n \nFollowing simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\r\nTake off the cap.\r\nShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\r\nIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\r\nBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\r\nPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\r\nWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\r\nRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\r\nIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\r\nAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\r\nCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\r\nInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion.

Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\r\nPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\r\nHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r\n \nFormoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r\n \nBudesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.",

This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMonocast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monocast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monocast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monocast. Although Monocast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monocast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMonocast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monocast.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rBronkolax may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBronkolax should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Bronkolax may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Bronkolax is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nBronkolax is indicated as a bronchodilator for use in-\r\nAsthma\r\nChronic Bronchitis\r\nEmphysema and\r\nOther conditions associated with airways obstruction.\r\nSaltica - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalbutamol is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent with predominant beta-2 adrenergic activity. Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\r\nChildren:\r\n2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\n6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\nOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\r\nAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r\n \nSalbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\n \nMethod-1 (Intermittent Administration):\r\nAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\r\nSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r\nChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r\nMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nBronkolax may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBronkolax should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Bronkolax may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Bronkolax is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Bexitrol F contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Bexitrol F inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Bexitrol F inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise.

At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rAzmasol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAzmasol and non-selective beta-blocking drugs such as propranolol should generally not be prescribed together. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rAzmasol is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Azmasol\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salbutamol inhaler or salbutamol sulfate in pregnant women. This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Azmasol sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Azmasol inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Azmasol inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Azmasol inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiograms (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST-segment depression. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Azmasol inhaler, like all other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\r Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of Azmasol sulfate inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. Discontinue Azmasol inhaler if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur.\r Coexisting Conditions: Azmasol inhaler, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.

This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMontril has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montril did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montril was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montril approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montril. No dosage adjustment for Montril is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montril.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontril is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montril can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montril should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montril should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montril. Although Montril is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montril and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

At therapeutic doses, it acts on the β2-adrenoceptors of bronchial smooth muscle, with little or no action on the β1-adrenoceptors of cardiac muscle. Salbutamol provides short-acting (4-6 hours) bronchodilatation with a fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction. It also has an anti-inflammatory effect on mast cells causing inhibition of release of bronchoconstrictor mediators including histamine, neutrophil chemotactive factor (NCF) and prostaglandin D2.\rDosage\rAdminister Salbutamol Inhaler by oral inhalation only. Shake Salbutamol Inhaler well before each spray.\r For relief of acute episodes of bronchospasm:\rAdults: 1 or 2 puffs as necessary. The maximum dose is up to 8 puffs in 24 hours.\rChildren: Half the adult dose.\rTo prevent allergen-or exercise-induced bronchospasm:\rAdults: 2 puffs 15 minutes prior to exercise or exposure to the allergen. The maximum dose is 2 puffs, up to 4 times a day.\rChildren: Half the adult dose.\rChronic therapy:\rAdults: Up to 200 mcg (2 puffs) four times daily.\rChildren: Up to 200 mcg (2 puffs) four times daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAsmalin and non-selective beta-blocking drugs such as propranolol should generally not be prescribed together. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rAsmalin is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Asmalin\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salbutamol inhaler or salbutamol sulfate in pregnant women. This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Asmalin sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Asmalin inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Asmalin inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Asmalin inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiograms (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST-segment depression. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Asmalin inhaler, like all other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\r Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of Asmalin sulfate inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. Discontinue Asmalin inhaler if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur.\r Coexisting Conditions: Asmalin inhaler, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Large doses of intravenous Asmalin have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children: The safety and effectiveness of Asmalin inhaler in children 4 years of age and older have been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rPressurized canister.

For the treatment of dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\rMiscellaneous: Diagnostic testing of adrenocortical hyperfunction, trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement, tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy.\rPharmacology\rDexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.\rDosage & Administration\rIn general, glucocorticoid dosage depends on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient. If no favourable response is noted within a couple of days, continuation of glucocorticoid therapy is undesirable. In chronic conditions requiring long-term therapy the lowest dosage that provides adequate, but not necessarily complete, relief should be used.\r For tablet:\rIn adult patients, daily oral dosages vary from 1 mg to 10 mg and in children from 0.03-0.20 mg/kg body weight,according to the individual response.\rIn some patients higher dosages may be temporarily required,to control the disease. As soon as circumstances permit,dosage should be decreased.\rFor a short dexamethasone suppression test 1 mg dexamethasone is given at 11 p.m. and plasmacortisol measured the next morning.\rPatients who do not show a decrease in cortisol can be exposed to a longer test: 0.5 mg dexamethasone is given at 6-hour intervals\rfor 48 hours followed by 2 mg every 6 hours for a further 48 hours. 24-hour urine collections are made before, during and at the end of the test for the determination of 17 alpha-hydroxycorticoids.\rFor injection:\rDexamethasone can be given by intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) or local injection. Dexamethasone injections can also be diluted with an infusion fluid or be injected directly into the infusion line.\rIntravenous injections of massive doses should be given slowly, over a period of several minutes.\rIntramuscular administration should be given by deep intramuscular injection,to prevent atrophy of the subcutaneous adipose tissues.\rIntra-articular injections should be given under strictly aseptic conditions as glucocorticoids decrease the resistance to infection. When diluted with these infusion fluids, Dexamethasone will keep its potency for at least 24 hours (at room temperature and in daylight conditions). As infusion fluids, Sodium chloride 0.9%, Anhydrous glucose 5%, Invert sugar 10%, Sorbitol 5%, Ringer's solution, Hartman's solution (Ringer-lactate) etc.can be used.\rThe dosage of Dexamethasone depends on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient.\rFor systemic therapy in adults, daily doses of 0.05-0.20 mg/kg body weight are usually sufficient. For emergencies (e.g. anaphylaxis, acute severe asthma, cerebral edema) substantially higher doses are required. An initial dose of 10-20 mg IV is followed by 6 mg IV or IM every 6 hours,until a satisfactory result has been obtained. Thereafter the dosage has to be tapered off gradually.\rFor local therapy, the following doses are recommended:\rIntra-articularly: 2-4 mg in large and 0.8-1 mg in small joints\rIntrabursally: 2-4 mg;in tendon sheaths:0.4-1 mg\rThe frequency of these injections may vary from every 3-5 days to every 2-3 weeks\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDiuretics and/or cardiac glycosides, since potassium loss may be enhanced.This is a particular risk in patients using cardiac glycosides; since hypokalaemia increases the toxicity of these drugs.\rAntidiabetics, since glucocorticoids may impair glucose tolerance, thereby increasing the need for antidiabetic drugs.\rNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, since the incidence and/or severity of gastro-intestinal ulceration may increase.\rOral anti-coagulants since glucocorticoids may alter the need for these drugs.\rGlucocorticoids may be less effective when used concomitantly with liver enzyme inducing drugs,such as rifampicin, ephedrine, barbiturates, phenytoin and primidone.\rIf patients undergoing long-term therapy with glucocorticoids are concomitantly given salicylates, any reduction in glucocorticoid dosage should be made with caution, since salicylate intoxication has been reported in such cases.\rAntacids;especially those containing magnesium trisilicate,have been reported to impair the gastro-intestinal absorption of glucocorticoids. Therefore, doses of one agent should be spaced as far as possible from the other.\rContraindications\rGastric and duodenal ulcers.\rSystemic and ophthalmic fungal infections.\rViral infections, e.g. varicella and herpes genitalis infections. Viral infections of the eye.\rGlaucoma.\rHypersensitivity to corticosteroids\rSide Effects\rThe following adverse reactions have been associated with prolonged systemic glucocorticoid therapy.\r Endocrine and metabolic disturbances: Cushing-like syndrome, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, premature epiphyseal closure, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, decreased glucose tolerance, negative nitrogen and calcium balance.\r Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium and fluid retention, hypertension, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis.\r Musculo-skeletal effects: Myopathy, abdominal distension, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads.\r Gastro-intestinal effects: Gastric and duodenal ulceration, perforation and haemorrhage.\r Dermatological effects: Impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, striae, petechiae and ecchymoses, bruising, facial erythema, increased sweating, acne.\r Central Nervous System effects: Psychic disturbances ranging from euphoria to frank psychotic manifestations,convulsions,in children pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) with vomiting and papilloedema.\r Ophthalmic effects: Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.\r Immunosuppressive effects: Increased susceptibility to infections, decreased responsiveness to vaccination and skin tests.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Glucocorticoids appear in breast milk.Mothers taking high dosages of corticosteroids should be advised not to breast-feed\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment.The reduction should be gradual.\r Cardio-renal: These agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure,hypertension, or renal insufficiency.\r Endocrine: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage.\r Gastrointestinal: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation.\r Musculoskeletal: Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g.,postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.\r Neuro-psychiatric: An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with myasthenia gravis or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). Psychic derangements may appear ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage is unlikely, however, treatment of overdosage is by supportive and symptomatic therapy\rStorage Conditions\rTablet: Store in a cool & dry place, protected from light & moisture.\rInjection: Store below 30° C, protected from light.Do not freeze.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rSalmolin may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSalmolin should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Salmolin may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Salmolin is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise.

Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rSalmolin is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients.

This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Salmolin sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Salmolin inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Salmolin inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Salmolin inhaler may need to be discontinued.

Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rSalmolin is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Salmolin\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salbutamol inhaler or salbutamol sulfate in pregnant women. This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Salmolin sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Salmolin inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Salmolin inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Salmolin inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiograms (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST-segment depression. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Salmolin inhaler, like all other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\r Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of Salmolin sulfate inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. Discontinue Salmolin inhaler if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur.\r Coexisting Conditions: Salmolin inhaler, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Large doses of intravenous Salmolin have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in children: The safety and effectiveness of Salmolin inhaler in children 4 years of age and older have been established.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rPressurized canister.

At therapeutic doses, it acts on the β2-adrenoceptors of bronchial smooth muscle, with little or no action on the β1-adrenoceptors of cardiac muscle. Salbutamol provides short-acting (4-6 hours) bronchodilatation with a fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction. It also has an anti-inflammatory effect on mast cells causing inhibition of release of bronchoconstrictor mediators including histamine, neutrophil chemotactive factor (NCF) and prostaglandin D2.\r\nDosage\r\nAdminister Salbutamol Inhaler by oral inhalation only. Shake Salbutamol Inhaler well before each spray.\r\n \nFor relief of acute episodes of bronchospasm:\r\nAdults: 1 or 2 puffs as necessary.

Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).

Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Salflu contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Salflu inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Salflu inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs Salflu contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r\n \nSalmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r\n \nFluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r\n \nLactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r\n \nAsthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r\n \nParadoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r\n \nUse in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r\n \nCorticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNo human over dosage data has been reported for Salflu inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r\n \nSalmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\n \nFluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Salflu inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.",

Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water.

The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Salflu contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Salflu inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Salflu inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMonas OFT has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas OFT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas OFT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas OFT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas OFT. No dosage adjustment for Monas OFT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas OFT.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonas OFT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas OFT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas OFT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas OFT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas OFT. Although Monas OFT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas OFT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas OFT did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas OFT was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas OFT approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas OFT. No dosage adjustment for Monas OFT is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas OFT.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMonas OFT is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas OFT can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas OFT should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas OFT should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas OFT. Although Monas OFT is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monas OFT and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMonas has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monas did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monas was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monas approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monas. No dosage adjustment for Monas is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monas.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMonas is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monas can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monas should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monas should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monas. Although Monas is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports.

        "description": "Indications\rThis inhalation aerosol is indicated for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on a regular aerosol bronchodilator who continues to have evidence of bronchospasm and who requires a second bronchodilator.\rPharmacology\rThis inhalation aerosol is a combination of Salbutamol (as Sulphate) and Ipratropium Bromide. It is a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) based environment friendly inhaler. Because it does not contain chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as propellant which is one of the main reasons of ozone layer depletion.\r Salbutamol is a short acting beta2-adrenergic bronchodilator and Ipratropium Bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. When used in combination, Ipratropium Bromide prevents the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which are caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle. This inhalation aerosol is expected to maximize the response of the treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms, anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) and sympathomimetic. Simultaneous administration of an anticholinergic (Ipratropium Bromide) and a beta 2-sympathomimetic (Salbutamol) is designed to benefit the patient by producing a greater bronchodilatory effect than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage.\rDosage\rAdult dose (Including the elderly): 2 puffs of Salpium 4 times a day (Patients may take additional puffs as required but a total number of puffs should not exceed 12 in 24 hours). Or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThis inhalation aerosol has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines and steroids, commonly used in the treatment of COPD. No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with this inhalation aerosol and these or other medications commonly used in the treatment of COPD. Ipratropium Bromide should be co-administered cautiously with other anticholinergic agents and sympathomimetic agents, which may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Beta-2-agonist containing drugs, like this inhalation aerosol, should be administrated with extreme caution in patients with non-potassium sparing diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.\rContraindications\rThis inhalation aerosol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Soya-Lecithin or related food products such as soybean and peanut. This inhalation aerosol is also contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any other components of the drug product or to atropine or its derivatives.\rSide Effects\rDue to presence of Salbutamol, mild tremor and headache have been reported. These usually disappear with continuous treatment. There have been very rare reports of treatments muscle cramp, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm and hypotension.\r For the presence of Ipratropium Bromide headache, influenza, chest pain, nausea, dyspnea, coughing, pharyngitis, sinusitis are rarely reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIpratropium Bromide: Pregnancy category B. Studies have demonstrated no teratogenic effects as a result of ipratropium.\r Salbutamol: Pregnancy category C. Salbutamol has been shown to be teratogenic in animals.\r There are, however no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salpium Inhalation Aerosol (Salbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide combination) in pregnant woman. This inhalation aerosol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether the components of the Salpium InhalationAerosol are excreted in human milk. As many drugs are excreted in human milk, Salpium should be cautiously administered to a nursing mother.\rUse in Special Populations\rThis inhalation aerosol contains Ipratropium Bromide and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction. Preparations containing sympathomimetic amines such as Salbutamol Sulphate should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.\rOverdose Effects\rThe effects of overdosage are expected to be related primarily to Salbutamol Sulphate. Manifestations of overdosage with Salbutamol may include anginal pain, hypertension, hypokalemia and tachycardia.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined bronchodilators\rStorage Conditions\rDo not puncture, break or incinerate the pressurized canister even when apparently empty.

        "description": "Indications\rBrodil is indicated as a bronchodilator for use in-\rAsthma\rChronic Bronchitis\rEmphysema and\rOther conditions associated with airways obstruction.\rSaltica - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rSalbutamol is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent with predominant beta-2 adrenergic activity. Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Brodil is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nBrodil is indicated as a bronchodilator for use in-\r\nAsthma\r\nChronic Bronchitis\r\nEmphysema and\r\nOther conditions associated with airways obstruction.\r\nSaltica - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalbutamol is a synthetic sympathomimetic agent with predominant beta-2 adrenergic activity. Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\r\nChildren:\r\n2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\n6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\nOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\r\nAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r\n \nSalbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\n \nMethod-1 (Intermittent Administration):\r\nAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\r\nSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r\nChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r\nMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage.

The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Brodil is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

At therapeutic doses, it acts on the β2-adrenoceptors of bronchial smooth muscle, with little or no action on the β1-adrenoceptors of cardiac muscle. Salbutamol provides short-acting (4-6 hours) bronchodilatation with a fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week.

Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rBrodil is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Brodil\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C.

This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Brodil sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Brodil inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Brodil inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Brodil inhaler may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiograms (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST-segment depression. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Brodil inhaler, like all other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\r Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of Brodil sulfate inhalation aerosol, as demonstrated by cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. Discontinue Brodil inhaler if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur.\r Coexisting Conditions: Brodil inhaler, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMonfast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monfast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monfast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monfast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monfast. No dosage adjustment for Monfast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monfast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonfast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monfast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monfast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monfast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monfast. Although Monfast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monfast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \r\nThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\r\nPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\r\nThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\r\nUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r\n \nHepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r\n \nRenal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r\n \nElderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nReversair has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Reversair did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Reversair was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Reversair approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Reversair. No dosage adjustment for Reversair is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Reversair.\r\nContraindications\r\nMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r\n \nUncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r\n \nRare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nReversair is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Reversair can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Reversair should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Reversair should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Reversair. Although Reversair is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Reversair and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children. Docopa should be used only on prescription of specialist physician.\nIndications\r\nDocopa is used to treat in following indications: \r\nBronchial asthma,\r\nBronchospasm,\r\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\r\nPulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nDoxophylline is a novel bronchodilator. It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r\n \nAdults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r\n \nChildren:\r\n>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r\n6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r\nIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDocopa should not be administered with other xanthine preparations.

Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from β2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\rContraindications\rSalbutamol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salbutamol or any other components of Salbutamol inhaler.\rSide Effects\rAzmasol is generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been observed during inhalation. There are tremors, anxiety, muscle cramps, headache, palpitation, a compensatory small increase in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles), tachycardia may occur in some patients. Mouth and throat irritation may occur with inhaled Azmasol\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Salbutamol inhaler or salbutamol sulfate in pregnant women. This inhaler should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether the components of Salbutamol inhaler are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when this inhaler is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rParadoxical Bronchospasm: Inhaled Azmasol sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, the Azmasol inhaler should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm when associated with inhaled formulations; frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister.\r Cardiovascular Effects: Azmasol inhaler, like all other β2-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure. If such effects occur, Azmasol inhaler may need to be discontinued.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rAzmasol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAzmasol should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Azmasol may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Azmasol is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r\n \nSalbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\n \nMethod-1 (Intermittent Administration):\r\nAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\r\nSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r\nChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r\nMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nAzmasol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nAzmasol should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Azmasol may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Azmasol is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Seroxyn contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Seroxyn inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Seroxyn inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rSalmolin may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rSalmolin should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Salmolin may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Salmolin is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monocast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monocast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monocast. Although Monocast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monocast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Monocast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Monocast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Monocast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Monocast. No dosage adjustment for Monocast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Monocast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMonocast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Monocast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Monocast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Monocast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Monocast. Although Monocast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Monocast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the Maxhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r Administration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.\rSide Effects\rAs this preparation contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAdministration of drugs during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of Salmeterol Xinafoate and Fluticasone Propionate in human pregnancy and lactation. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rConsideration should be given to additional corticosteroid therapies, and to including administration of antibiotics if an infection is present. As with all inhaled medication containing corticosteroids, this preparation should be administered with caution in patients with active or quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis. This preparation should be administered with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate.

At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\r\nChildren:\r\n2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\n6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r\nOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\r\nAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r\n \nSalbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\n \nMethod-1 (Intermittent Administration):\r\nAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\r\nSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r\nChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r\nMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Protide contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Protide inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Protide inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes.

Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r\n \nAsthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r\n \nParadoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r\n \nUse in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r\n \nCorticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nNo human over dosage data has been reported for Protide inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r\n \nSalmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\n \nFluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Protide inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.",

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Protide contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child.

Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Salflu contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Salflu inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Salflu inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition.

Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. It is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from inner ear. Triprolidine provides symptomatic relief in conditions believed to depend wholly or partly upon the triggered release of histamine. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness.\rDosage\rAdults & Children 12 years of age and older: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 6 to under 12 years of age: ½ teaspoonful (2.5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 2 to 6 years: To be used with caution, and as advised by the physician for children aged 2 to 6 years.\r Children below 2 years old: Not to be used in children below 2 years old.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rTake with or without food. Take with food if it causes an upset stomach. Measure liquid doses carefully.

Avoid taking isocarboxazid, methylene blue, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine during treatment with this medication. Most MAO inhibitors should also not be taken for two weeks before treatment with this medication. Caution should be excercised while taking Dexpoten Plus with antihistamines applied to the skin (such as diphenhydramine cream, ointment, spray), antispasmodics (e.g. atropine, belladonna alkaloids), beta blockers (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol), drugs for Parkinson’s disease (e.g. anticholinergics such as benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), guanethidine, certain inhaled anesthetics (e.g. halothane), methyldopa, reserpine, scopolamine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine), anti seizure drugs (e.g. carbamazepine), medicine for sleep or anxiety (e.g. alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem), muscle relaxants, narcotic pain relievers (e.g. codeine), psychiatric medicines (e.g. chlorpromazine, risperidone, amitriptyline, trazodone).\rContraindications\rIt should be avoided in patients with liver disease or asthmatic patients and is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or within 2 weeks from stopping such treatment, known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and during acute attacks of asthma. It is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.\rSide Effects\rIt may cause drowsiness, dottiness and constipation. Other side effects that may occur include GIT discomfort. No apparent evidence of physical dependence of the morphine type. Other less common side effects may include transient hypertension, dry mouth, restlessness, palpitations, allergic reactions such as rashes, tightness of chest, thickening of bronchial secretions, toxic psychosis and blood dyscrasia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs with any other drugs, use in pregnancy and lactation is best avoided.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDexpoten Plus may cause drowsiness. If affected, do not drive motor vehicle or operate machinery. Avoid alcoholic drink while on this medication. Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, hepatic disease, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloro-duodenal obstruction or bladder neck obstruction, unless under the medical advice and supervision. If symptoms do not improve within one week or accompanied with high fever, consult a physician before continuing use.\rOverdose Effects\rIn cases of over dosage, hospital admission is strongly advised. Over dosage may produce respiratory depression, paranoid psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, and convulsion. Treatment should include emptying the stomach by aspiration or gastric lavage. Nervous stimulation and convulsions should be treated with a sedative such as diazepam intramuscularly. If marked excitation is present, a sedative such as diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be given.\r Severe over dosage of phenylephrine hydrochloride may produce hypertension and associated reflex bradycardia. Treatment measures include early gastric lavage and symptomatic and supportive measures. The hypertensive effects may be treated with an alpha-receptor blocking agent (such as phentolamine mesilate 6-10 mg) given intravenously, and the bradycardia treated with atropine, preferable only after the pressure has been controlled.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined cough suppressants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMontene has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montene did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montene was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montene approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montene. No dosage adjustment for Montene is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montene.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontene is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montene can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montene should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montene should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montene. Although Montene is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montene and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

Although structurally related to morphine, it has no analgesic properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Addiction has not been observed after the administration of rather large doses for prolonged period. It is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and exerts its effects in 15-30 minutes after oral administration. The duration of action is approximately 3-6 hours with conventional dosage form. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is extensively metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine as unchanged Dextromethorphan and demethylated metabolites including Dextrophan which has some cough suppressant activity. Urinary excretion of parent and metabolites accounts for up to 50% of the ingested dose over 24 hours. About 8% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine over the first 6 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and Children over 12 years: 15 to 30 mg three to four times per day. However, 60 mg doses up to four times per day have been used without increased side effects.\r Children between 6 and 12 years: 5-15 mg up to four times per day.\r Children between 2 and 6 years: 2.5-5 mg up to four times per day.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTwo fatal interactions have been reported in patients taking therapeutic doses of phenelzine and dextromethorphan.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated with Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolised in the liver and should be prescribed with caution to patients with liver disease.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects with Tomephen are rare, but nausea and dizziness sometimes occur. The drug produces no analgesia or addiction and little or no CNS depression. Excitation, confusion and respiratory depression may occur after overdosage.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information on the use of this drug in pregnancy and therefore it should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy. No information is available on secretion of dextromethorphan into breast milk, so nursing mothers should be advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDo not use Tomephen to control a cough that is associated with smoking, asthma, or emphysema, or a cough that is productive (produces sputum or phlegm).\rTherapeutic Class\rCough suppressant\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rM-Kast has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of M-Kast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, M-Kast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of M-Kast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of M-Kast. No dosage adjustment for M-Kast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with M-Kast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rM-Kast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with M-Kast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, M-Kast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. M-Kast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking M-Kast. Although M-Kast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of M-Kast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the long-term once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It should not be used in acute episodes of bronchospasm. This is not indicated for asthma.\rComposition\rEach dry powder inhaler capsule contains-\rIndacaterol 110 mcg as Indacaterol Maleate INN (Micronized)\rGlycopyrronium 50 mcg as Glycopyrronium Bromide BP (Micronized)\rPharmacology\rThis is an inhalation powder drug product for delivery of a combination of Glycopyrronium (an anticholinergic) and Indacaterol (a LABA) to patients by oral inhalation. The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including Indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Glycopyrronium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults (18 years or older): For oral inhalation only. Should be used at the same time every day, not more than 1 time every 24 hours.\r Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation once daily.\r Limitations of use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.\r Geriatric: This can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (65 years of age and older).\r Use in Children & Adolescents: It is not indicated for use in children and adolescents. The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients (aged 17 years and younger) have not been established.\r Renal impairment: It can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), it should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk.\r Hepatic impairment: It can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data available for the use of this in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore caution should be observed in these patients.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo specific interaction studies were conducted for Glycopyrronium and Indacaterol combination. Information on the potential for interactions is based on the potential for each individual component. The concomitant use of Glycopyrronium and Indacaterol with β-adrenergic blockers, anticholinergics or sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. Sympathomimetic agents may potentiate the adverse events of Indacaterol. Caution is required with the concomitant use of hypokalemic treatment.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Glycopyrronium or Indacaterol, or to any other component of this combination; Patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins and All LABA are contraindicated in patients with asthma without use of a long-term asthma control medication.\rSide Effects\rAdverse reactions that have been associated with muscarinic antagonists include cardiovascular effects (atrial arrhythmias and tachycardia), ocular disorders (e.g., blurred vision), urinary retention, gastrointestinal disorders, dry mouth and cough. Adverse reactions that have been associated with β2-agonists include immediate hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, edema and angioedema), cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, arrhythmia, palpitations, myocardial ischaemia, hypertension or. hypotension), hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, headache, nervousness, insomnia, muscle spasms, fatigue, malaise and tremor. The most common adverse drug reactions related to the drug product (reported >3% and greater than placebo) were cough and oropharyngeal pain (including throat irritation).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. There are no data from the use of this combination in pregnant women available. Therefore, this combination should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the foetus. It is not known whether Indacaterol or Glycopyrronium and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. The use of this combination by breast-feeding women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.\rDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms.\rDo not use in combination with additional therapy containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.\rIf paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue and institute alternative therapy.\rUse with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.\rUse with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.\rWorsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.\rWorsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur.\rBe alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no information on clinically relevant overdosing with Onriva Plus. An overdose could lead to exaggerated effects typical of β2-adrenergic stimulants, i.e. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and hyperglycaemia or could induce anticholinergic effects such as increased intraocular pressure (causing pain, vision disturbances or reddening of the eye), obstipation or difficulties in voiding. Supportive and symptomatic treatment is indicated. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalized.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined bronchodilators\rStorage Conditions\rAvoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store in a cool & dry place.

Read more\rFexocold-fexorush - MedEx campaign banner\rAirway-sharpkil - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.\r Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.\rDosage & Administration\rAllergic Rhinitis-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml once daily\r Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria-\r Adults and children 12 years and older:\rTablet: 60 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily or 180 mg once daily \rIn case of impaired renal function: 60 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 to 11 years:\rTablet: 30 mg twice daily or 60 mg once daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg once daily\rChildren from 6 months to less than 2 years:\rSuspension: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 15 mg or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) once daily\rChildren from 2 to 11 years:\rSuspension: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) twice daily\rIn case of impaired renal function: 30 mg or 5 ml (1 tsp) once daily\r * চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDinafex does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and therefore will not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Coadministration of Dinafex with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in a 2-3 times increase in the level of fexofenadine in plasma. The changes were not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval and were not associated with any increase in adverse reactions compared to the medicinal products given singly. No interaction between fexofenadine and omeprazole was observed. However, the administration of an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to Dinafex caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastrointestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of Dinafex and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fexofenadine Hydrochloride or any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rThe following frequency rating has been used, when applicable: Very common ≥1/10; Common ≥1/100 and <1/10; Uncommon ≥1/1,000 and <1/100; Rare ≥1/10,000 and <1/1,000; Very rare <1/10,000 and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in clinical trials, with an incidence similar to that observed with placebo: Nervous system disorders- Common: headache, drowsiness, dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders- Common: nausea; General disorders and administration site conditions- Uncommon: fatigue. In adults, the following undesirable effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency with which they occur is not known (cannot be estimated from available data): Immune system disorders- hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis; Psychiatric disorders- insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or nightmares/excessive dreaming (paroniria); Cardiac disorders- tachycardia, palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders- diarrhea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- rash, urticaria, pruritus\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate data from the use of Fexofenadine hydrochloride in pregnant women. Limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\r There are no data on the content of human milk after administering Fexofenadine hydrochloride. However, when Terfenadine was administered to nursing mothers Fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Therefore, Fexofenadine hydrochloride is not recommended for mothers breast-feeding their babies. No human data on the effect of Fexofenadine hydrochloride on fertility are available. In mice, there was no effect on fertility with Fexofenadine hydrochloride treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs with most new medicinal products there is only limited data in the older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Dinafex should be administered with care in these special groups. Patients with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that, antihistamines as a medicine class, have been associated with the adverse reactions, tachycardia and palpitations.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: On the basis of the pharmacodynamic profile and reported adverse reactions it is unlikely that Dinafex tablets will produce an effect on the ability to drive or use machines. In objective tests, Dinafex has been shown to have no significant effects on central nervous system function. This means that patients may drive or perform tasks that require concentration. However, in order to identify sensitive people who have an unusual reaction to medicinal products, it is advisable to check the individual response before driving or performing complicated tasks.\rUse in Special Populations\rRenal and hepatic impaired patient: The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine are altered in individuals with renal impairment. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function. Moderate to severe hepatic disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine substantially.\r Elderly patient: Adverse events were similar in this group compared to patients under 65 years of age. Nevertheless, the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine is altered (increased bioavailability) in individuals over 65 years of age.\rOverdose Effects\rDizziness, drowsiness, fatigue and dry mouth have been reported with overdose of Dinafex. Single doses up to 800 mg and doses up to 690 mg twice daily for 1 month or 240 mg once daily for 1 year have been administered to healthy subjects without the development of clinically significant adverse reactions as compared with placebo. The maximum tolerated dose of Dinafex has not been established. Standard measures should be considered to remove any unabsorbed medicinal product. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Haemodialysis does not effectively remove Dinafex from blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rNon-sedating antihistamines\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

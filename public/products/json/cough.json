        "description": "Indications\rDoxiva is used to treat in following indications: \rBronchial asthma,\rBronchospasm,\rChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\rPulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rDoxophylline is a novel bronchodilator. It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDoxiva should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Doxiva together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children. Doxiva should be used only on prescription of specialist physician.\r\nIndications\r\nDoxiva is used to treat in following indications: \r\nBronchial asthma,\r\nBronchospasm,\r\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\r\nPulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nDoxophylline is a novel bronchodilator.

Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. It is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from inner ear. Triprolidine provides symptomatic relief in conditions believed to depend wholly or partly upon the triggered release of histamine. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness.\rDosage\rAdults & Children 12 years of age and older: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 6 to under 12 years of age: ½ teaspoonful (2.5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 2 to 6 years: To be used with caution, and as advised by the physician for children aged 2 to 6 years.\r Children below 2 years old: Not to be used in children below 2 years old.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rTake with or without food. Take with food if it causes an upset stomach. Measure liquid doses carefully. Use the measuring device that comes with this medicine.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTaking certain MAO inhibitors with this medication may cause a serious (possibly fatal) drug interaction. Avoid taking isocarboxazid, methylene blue, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine during treatment with this medication. Most MAO inhibitors should also not be taken for two weeks before treatment with this medication. Caution should be excercised while taking Dexpoten Plus with antihistamines applied to the skin (such as diphenhydramine cream, ointment, spray), antispasmodics (e.g. atropine, belladonna alkaloids), beta blockers (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol), drugs for Parkinson’s disease (e.g. anticholinergics such as benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), guanethidine, certain inhaled anesthetics (e.g. halothane), methyldopa, reserpine, scopolamine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine), anti seizure drugs (e.g. carbamazepine), medicine for sleep or anxiety (e.g. alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem), muscle relaxants, narcotic pain relievers (e.g. codeine), psychiatric medicines (e.g. chlorpromazine, risperidone, amitriptyline, trazodone).\rContraindications\rIt should be avoided in patients with liver disease or asthmatic patients and is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or within 2 weeks from stopping such treatment, known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and during acute attacks of asthma. It is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.\rSide Effects\rIt may cause drowsiness, dottiness and constipation. Other side effects that may occur include GIT discomfort. No apparent evidence of physical dependence of the morphine type. Other less common side effects may include transient hypertension, dry mouth, restlessness, palpitations, allergic reactions such as rashes, tightness of chest, thickening of bronchial secretions, toxic psychosis and blood dyscrasia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs with any other drugs, use in pregnancy and lactation is best avoided.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDexpoten Plus may cause drowsiness. If affected, do not drive motor vehicle or operate machinery. Avoid alcoholic drink while on this medication. Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, hepatic disease, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloro-duodenal obstruction or bladder neck obstruction, unless under the medical advice and supervision. If symptoms do not improve within one week or accompanied with high fever, consult a physician before continuing use.\rOverdose Effects\rIn cases of over dosage, hospital admission is strongly advised. Over dosage may produce respiratory depression, paranoid psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, and convulsion. Treatment should include emptying the stomach by aspiration or gastric lavage. Nervous stimulation and convulsions should be treated with a sedative such as diazepam intramuscularly. If marked excitation is present, a sedative such as diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be given.\r Severe over dosage of phenylephrine hydrochloride may produce hypertension and associated reflex bradycardia. Treatment measures include early gastric lavage and symptomatic and supportive measures. The hypertensive effects may be treated with an alpha-receptor blocking agent (such as phentolamine mesilate 6-10 mg) given intravenously, and the bradycardia treated with atropine, preferable only after the pressure has been controlled.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined cough suppressants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

Salbutamol Sulphate is a\rbeta2-adrenergic agent which acts on airway smooth muscle resulting in relaxation. Salbutamol relaxes all smooth muscle from the\rtrachea to the terminal bronchioles and protects against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. Ipratropium Bromide is a quaternary\rammonium compound with anticholinergic properties. In preclinical studies, it appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by\rantagonising the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the\rincrease of intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with\rmuscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. The bronchodilation following inhalation of Ipratropium Bromide is primarily\rlocal and site specific to the lung and not systemic in nature. Windel Plus provides the simultaneous release of Ipratropium\rBromide and Salbutamol allowing the synergistic efficacy on the muscarinic and beta2-adrenergic receptors in the airways to cause\rbronchodilation which is superior to that provided by each single agent and with no potentiation of adverse events.\r  INDICATIONS\r Windel Plus is indicated for the treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with obstructive airway diseases in patients who\rrequire more than a single bronchodilator.\r    DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Windel Plus inhalation solution in ampoule may be administered from a suitable nebuliser or an intermittent positive pressure\rventilator.\r Adults (including elderly): One ampoule as required for the relief of symptoms or as directed. Up to three to four ampoules daily.\r Patients should be advised to consult a doctor or the nearest hospital immediately in the case of acute or rapidly worsening\rdyspnoea if additional inhalations do not produce an adequate improvement.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Windel Plus inhalation solution in ampoule may be administered from a suitable nebuliser or an intermittent positive pressure\rventilator.\r Adults (including elderly): One ampoule as required for the relief of symptoms or as directed.

No\rsuspect teratogenic factors have been observed in general practice or clinical studies. As a general precaution, however, Windel\rPlus should only be used in pregnancy and during the lactation period if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any\rpossible risk to the child.\r Windel Plus should be used with caution before childbirth in view of Salbutamol's inhibitory effects on uterine contractions.\r Salbutamol Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide are probably excreted in breast milk and their effects on neonates are not known.\rAlthough lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that this will happen to any extent especially\rwhen taken by inhalation. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when Windel Plus is\radministered to a nursing woman.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r The concurrent administration of other beta-mimetics, systemically absorbed anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives may increase\rthe side effects.\rBeta-agonist induced hypokalaemia may be increased by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, glucocorticosteroids and\rdiuretics. This should be taken into account particularly in patients with severe airway obstruction.\r Hypokalaemia may result in an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients receiving digoxin. It is recommended that serum\rpotassium levels be monitored in such situations.\r A potentially serious reduction in bronchodilator effect may occur during concurrent administration of beta-blockers.\r Beta-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or\rtricyclic antidepressants, since the action of beta-adrenergic agonists may be enhanced.\r Inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbon anaesthetics such as halothane, trichloroethylene and enflurane may increase the\rsusceptibility to the cardiovascular effects of beta-agonists.\r  OVER DOSE\r The effects of overdosage are expected to be primarily related to Salbutamol because acute overdosage with Ipratropium Bromide is\runlikely as it is not well absorbed systemically after inhalation or oral administration.\r Symptoms\rManifestations of overdosage with Salbutamol may include tachycardia, anginal pain, hypertension, hypotension , palpitations,\rtremor, widening of the pulse pressure, arrhythmia and flushing.\r Therapy\rAdministration of sedatives, tranquillisers.\rIn severe cases, intensive therapy.\rBeta-receptor blockers, preferably beta1-selective, are suitable as specific antidotes; however, a possible increase in bronchial\robstruction must be taken into account and the dose should be adjusted carefully in patients suffering from bronchial asthma.\r  STORAGE\r Store below 30°C (86°F).\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Windel Plus®: Each box contains 10 ampoules in blister packs.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nWindel® Plus: Each ampoule contains 2.5 ml isotonic, clear solution for inhalation of salbutamol sulphate BP equivalent to\r\nSalbutamol 2.5 mg and Ipratropium Bromide BP equivalent to Ipratropium 0.5 mg.\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nWindel Plus contains two active bronchodilating substances, Salbutamol Sulphate and Ipratropium Bromide.

The dose may be increased up to\r18 mg/kg daily on the basis of clinical response.\r Dosage Type: 6 mg/kg b.i.d\r Weight of the Child: 10 kg > Dosage: 3 ml\rWeight of the Child: 15 kg > Dosage: 4.5 ml\rWeight of the Child: 20 kg > Dosage: 6 ml\rWeight of the Child: 25 kg > Dosage: 7.5 ml\rWeight of the Child: 30 kg > Dosage: 9 ml\rWeight of the Child: 35 kg > Dosage: 10.5 ml\rWeight of the Child: 40 kg > Dosage: 12 ml\r Dosage Type: Total Daily Dose\r Weight of the Child: 10 kg > Dosage: 6 ml\rWeight of the Child: 15 kg > Dosage: 9 ml\rWeight of the Child: 20 kg > Dosage: 12 ml\rWeight of the Child: 25 kg > Dosage: 15 ml\rWeight of the Child: 30 kg > Dosage: 18 ml\rWeight of the Child: 35 kg > Dosage: 21 ml\rWeight of the Child: 40 kg > Dosage: 24 ml\r   Contrainidications:\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction and hypotension. It is also contraindicated in\rindividuals who have shown hypersensitivity to its components.\rWarning & Precautions:\rThe half-life of xanthine derivative is influenced by a number of variables. It may be prolonged in patients with liver disease,\rcongestive heart failure and in those patients taking certain other drugs (erythromycin, troleandomycin, lincomycin, allopurinol,\rcimetidine, propranolol and anti-flu vaccine). In these cases, a lower dose of Doxophylline may be needed. Phenytoin and other\ranticonvulsants may cause shorter mean half-life and in these cases higher doses of Doxophylline may be needed.\rSide effects:\rAfter administration occasionally nausea, vomiting, headache, etc. may occur\r   Drug interaction:\rDoxophylline should not be administered together with other xanthine derivatives. Toxic synergism with ephedrine has been\rdocumented for xanthines. Like other xanthines, concomitant therapy with erythromycin, troleandomycin, lincomycin, allopurinol,\rcimetidine, ranitidine, propranolol and anti-flu vaccine may decrease the hepatic clearance of xanthines causing an increase in\rblood levels.\rUse in special groups:\rUse in pregnancy: Animal reproduction studies indicate that Doxophylline does not cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant\ranimals nor can affect reproduction capacity. However, since there is limited experience in human during pregnancy, Doxophylline\rshould be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed.\rUse in nursing mothers: Doxophylline is contraindicated in nursing mothers.\rStorage:\rStore below 25°C and dry place, protect from light.\rPacking:\r- Docopa-200 Tablet: Each box contains 100 tablets in alu-alu blister pack.\r- Docopa Tablet: Each box contains 60 tablets in alu-alu blister pack.\r- Docopa Syrup: Each bottle contains 100 ml syrup.\nPresentation:\r\n- Docopa 200 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Doxophylline INN 200 mg.\r\n- Docopa Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Doxophylline INN 400 mg.\r\n- Docopa Syrup: Each 5 ml syrup contains Doxophylline INN 100 mg.\r\nPharmacology:\r\nDoxophylline is a new generation xanthine derivative which has a dioxolane group at N-7 position of its chemical structure.\r\nDoxophylline\r\ninhibits phosphodiesterase activities. Moreover, Doxophylline appears to have a less affinity towards adenosine A1 and A2\r\nreceptors\r\nwhich is account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline also inhibits platelet activating factor and the\r\ngeneration of\r\nleukotrienes.\r\nIndications:\r\nDocopa (Doxophylline) is used to treat asthma, COPD and bronchospasm.\r\nDosage & Administration:\r\nAdult:Â 400 mg (1 tablet) daily in the evening.

Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. It is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from inner ear. Triprolidine provides symptomatic relief in conditions believed to depend wholly or partly upon the triggered release of histamine. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness.\rDosage\rAdults & Children 12 years of age and older: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 6 to under 12 years of age: ½ teaspoonful (2.5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 2 to 6 years: To be used with caution, and as advised by the physician for children aged 2 to 6 years.\r Children below 2 years old: Not to be used in children below 2 years old.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rTake with or without food. Take with food if it causes an upset stomach. Measure liquid doses carefully. Use the measuring device that comes with this medicine.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTaking certain MAO inhibitors with this medication may cause a serious (possibly fatal) drug interaction. Avoid taking isocarboxazid, methylene blue, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine during treatment with this medication. Most MAO inhibitors should also not be taken for two weeks before treatment with this medication. Caution should be excercised while taking Dextrim with antihistamines applied to the skin (such as diphenhydramine cream, ointment, spray), antispasmodics (e.g. atropine, belladonna alkaloids), beta blockers (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol), drugs for Parkinson’s disease (e.g. anticholinergics such as benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), guanethidine, certain inhaled anesthetics (e.g. halothane), methyldopa, reserpine, scopolamine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine), anti seizure drugs (e.g. carbamazepine), medicine for sleep or anxiety (e.g. alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem), muscle relaxants, narcotic pain relievers (e.g. codeine), psychiatric medicines (e.g. chlorpromazine, risperidone, amitriptyline, trazodone).\rContraindications\rIt should be avoided in patients with liver disease or asthmatic patients and is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or within 2 weeks from stopping such treatment, known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and during acute attacks of asthma. It is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.\rSide Effects\rIt may cause drowsiness, dottiness and constipation. Other side effects that may occur include GIT discomfort. No apparent evidence of physical dependence of the morphine type. Other less common side effects may include transient hypertension, dry mouth, restlessness, palpitations, allergic reactions such as rashes, tightness of chest, thickening of bronchial secretions, toxic psychosis and blood dyscrasia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs with any other drugs, use in pregnancy and lactation is best avoided.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDextrim may cause drowsiness. If affected, do not drive motor vehicle or operate machinery. Avoid alcoholic drink while on this medication. Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, hepatic disease, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloro-duodenal obstruction or bladder neck obstruction, unless under the medical advice and supervision. If symptoms do not improve within one week or accompanied with high fever, consult a physician before continuing use.\rOverdose Effects\rIn cases of over dosage, hospital admission is strongly advised. Over dosage may produce respiratory depression, paranoid psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, and convulsion. Treatment should include emptying the stomach by aspiration or gastric lavage. Nervous stimulation and convulsions should be treated with a sedative such as diazepam intramuscularly. If marked excitation is present, a sedative such as diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be given.\r Severe over dosage of phenylephrine hydrochloride may produce hypertension and associated reflex bradycardia. Treatment measures include early gastric lavage and symptomatic and supportive measures. The hypertensive effects may be treated with an alpha-receptor blocking agent (such as phentolamine mesilate 6-10 mg) given intravenously, and the bradycardia treated with atropine, preferable only after the pressure has been controlled.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined cough suppressants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated for the long-term once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It should not be used in acute episodes of bronchospasm. This is not indicated for asthma.\rComposition\rEach dry powder inhaler capsule contains-\rIndacaterol 110 mcg as Indacaterol Maleate INN (Micronized)\rGlycopyrronium 50 mcg as Glycopyrronium Bromide BP (Micronized)\rPharmacology\rThis is an inhalation powder drug product for delivery of a combination of Glycopyrronium (an anticholinergic) and Indacaterol (a LABA) to patients by oral inhalation. The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including Indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3, 5-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. Glycopyrronium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults (18 years or older): For oral inhalation only. Should be used at the same time every day, not more than 1 time every 24 hours.\r Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation once daily.\r Limitations of use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.\r Geriatric: This can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (65 years of age and older).\r Use in Children & Adolescents: It is not indicated for use in children and adolescents. The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients (aged 17 years and younger) have not been established.\r Renal impairment: It can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), it should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk.\r Hepatic impairment: It can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data available for the use of this in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore caution should be observed in these patients.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo specific interaction studies were conducted for Glycopyrronium and Indacaterol combination. Information on the potential for interactions is based on the potential for each individual component. The concomitant use of Glycopyrronium and Indacaterol with β-adrenergic blockers, anticholinergics or sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. Sympathomimetic agents may potentiate the adverse events of Indacaterol. Caution is required with the concomitant use of hypokalemic treatment.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Glycopyrronium or Indacaterol, or to any other component of this combination; Patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins and All LABA are contraindicated in patients with asthma without use of a long-term asthma control medication.\rSide Effects\rAdverse reactions that have been associated with muscarinic antagonists include cardiovascular effects (atrial arrhythmias and tachycardia), ocular disorders (e.g., blurred vision), urinary retention, gastrointestinal disorders, dry mouth and cough. Adverse reactions that have been associated with β2-agonists include immediate hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, edema and angioedema), cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, arrhythmia, palpitations, myocardial ischaemia, hypertension or. hypotension), hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, headache, nervousness, insomnia, muscle spasms, fatigue, malaise and tremor. The most common adverse drug reactions related to the drug product (reported >3% and greater than placebo) were cough and oropharyngeal pain (including throat irritation).\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. There are no data from the use of this combination in pregnant women available. Therefore, this combination should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the foetus. It is not known whether Indacaterol or Glycopyrronium and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. The use of this combination by breast-feeding women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLABA monotherapy increases the risk of serious asthma-related events.\rDo not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms.\rDo not use in combination with additional therapy containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.\rIf paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue and institute alternative therapy.\rUse with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.\rUse with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.\rWorsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.\rWorsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur.\rBe alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no information on clinically relevant overdosing with Dilbro UniCap. An overdose could lead to exaggerated effects typical of β2-adrenergic stimulants, i.e. tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, ventricular arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and hyperglycaemia or could induce anticholinergic effects such as increased intraocular pressure (causing pain, vision disturbances or reddening of the eye), obstipation or difficulties in voiding. Supportive and symptomatic treatment is indicated. In serious cases, patients should be hospitalized.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined bronchodilators\rStorage Conditions\rAvoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store in a cool & dry place.

        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\rpatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\rpatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\rPharmacology\rSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction. Fluticasone Propionate is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity. Fluticasone Propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without systematic effects at usual dose. Salmeterol protects against symptoms, Fluticasone Propionate improves lung function and prevents exacerbations of the condition. This preparation can offer a more convenient regime for patients on concurrent β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The respective mechanisms of action of both drugs are discussed below:\r Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12-hour) beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain that binds to the exo-site of the receptor.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Fluticasone Propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, without the adverse effects observed when corticosteroids are administered systemically.\rDosage\rInhaler:\rAdults and adolescents 12 years and older: 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 125 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily or 2 puffs of 25 µg Salmeterol and 250 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\rChildren (4-12 years): 2 puffs of 25 µg salmeterol and 50 µg Fluticasone Propionate twice daily.\r Inhalation capsule (for asthma):\rAdult and Adolescent (12 Years and Older): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg or Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). \rThe recommended starting dosages for Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg & Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg for patients aged 12 years and older are based upon patients asthma severity. \rThe maximum recommended dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 500 µg twice daily.\rPediatric Patients (4 to 11 Years): For patients with asthma who are not controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid, the dosage is Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 100 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart).\rInhalation capsule (For COPD): Salmeterol 50 µg & Fluticasone 250 µg twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). Rinsing the mouth after each inhalation is advised.\r  Maxhaler (For Asthma): This is a moulded plastic device containing a foil strip with 60 regularly placed blisters containing pre-dispensed inhalation powder. Patients should be made aware that inhaler must be used daily for optimum benefit, even when asymptomatic.\r Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/250 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\r50/500 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rChildren (4 years and older)-\r50/100 inhaler: One Inhalation twice daily. The maximum licensed dose of fluticasone propionate delivered by this inhaler in children is 100 mcg twice daily. There are no data available for use of this inhaler in children aged under 4 years.\rMaxhaler (For COPD):\rInhaler: One Inhalation twice daily\rSpecial patient groups: There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment. There are no data available for use of this in patients with hepatic impairment.\rUsing the inhaler: This is a patient friendly, ready to use and easy to grip device. Use as per instructions for use.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBoth non-selective and selective β-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. Care should be taken when co-administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. This is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.\rSide Effects\rAs Ticamet contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below.\r Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2-agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache, have been reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angioedema. There have been reports of oropharyngeal irritation. There have been rare reports of muscle cramps.\r Fluticasone propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal oedema have been reported. Both hoarseness and incidence of candidiasis may be relieved by gargling with water after use of Salmeterol/ Fluticasone Propionate Inhaler.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Administration of this inhalation capsule during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid.\r Lactation: Administration of this inhalation capsule in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse in asthma patients: This inhalation capsule should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. This inhalation capsule is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.\r Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with this inhalation capsule. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of this inhalation capsule.\r Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. This inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy.\r Use in COPD patients: There was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap.\r Corticosteroids: This inhalation capsule contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained.\rUse in Special Populations\rOrally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to paediatric patients. The long-term effects of this reduction including the impact of final adult height are unknown.\rOverdose Effects\rNo human over dosage data has been reported for Ticamet inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below:\r Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of overdosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardioselective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose Ticamet inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.\rTherapeutic Class\rLong-acting selective β-adrenoceptor stimulants, Respiratory corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rPressurised canister, do not puncture, break or incinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30°C. Keep away from eyes. Keep away from children.\nIndications\r\nThis is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (long-acting β2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate:\r\npatients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or\r\npatients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist.\r\nPharmacology\r\nSalmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse airway obstruction.

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily. This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature\rUse in the pediatric patient: The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults.\r Hepatic Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.\r Renal Insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\r Elderly use: The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rMontene has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of Montene did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, Montene was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of Montene approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of Montene. No dosage adjustment for Montene is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with Montene.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rMontene is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Montene can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Montene should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Montene should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Montene. Although Montene is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Montene and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required.\rTherapeutic Class\rLeukotriene receptor antagonists\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rFlindof should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Flindof together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

It is hydrolyzed via esterase enzymes to its active metabolite beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (B-17-MP), which has high topical anti inflammatory activity.\r\nDosage\r\nBeclometasone dipropionate Inhaler is for oral inhalation use only. Patients should be given a starting dose of inhaled beclometasone dipropionate appropriate to the severity of their disease. The dose may then be adjusted until control is achieved, or reduced to the minimum effective dose according to individual response.\r\n \nAdults (including the elderly): The usual starting dose is 200 micrograms twice a day. In more severe cases the starting dose may need to increase to 600 to 800 micrograms per day which may then be reduced when the patient's asthma has stabilised. The total daily dose may be administered as two, three, or four divided doses\r\n \nChildren: 50 to 100 micrograms should be given two, three or four times daily in accordance to the response. Alternatively, 100 micrograms or 200 micrograms twice daily should be given. The usual starting dose is 100 micrograms twice daily. Beclometasone 250 Inhaler is not recommended for children.\r\n \nBeclometasone 250 HFA Inhaler: The usual starting dose is 200 micrograms twice a day. In more severe cases the starting dose may need to increase to 600 to 800 micrograms per day which may then be reduced when the patient's asthma has stabilised. The total daily dose may be administered as two, three, or four divided doses.\r\n \nThere is no need to increase the dose in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r\n \nFollowing simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\r\nTake off the cap.\r\nShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\r\nIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\r\nBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\r\nPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\r\nWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\r\nRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\r\nIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\r\nAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\r\nCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\r\nInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nContraindications\r\nHypersensitivity to any of the components. Special care is necessary in patients with active or quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSystemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, and adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, and glaucoma.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth retardation.\r\n \nThe use of beclometasone dipropionate in mothers breast feeding their babies requires that the therapeutic benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and baby.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients should be instructed in the proper use of the inhaler, and their technique checked, to ensure that the drug reaches the target areas within the lungs. They should also be made aware that Beclometasone Inhaler has to be used regularly, every day, even when they are asymptomatic, for optimum benefit.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nRespiratory corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nThe Inhaler should be stored below 30° C, protected from direct sunlight and heat. The canister should not be broken, punctured or burnt, even when apparently empty. Keep away from eyes. Keep out of reach of children.",

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPulmino should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Pulmino together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment.

        "description": "Indications\rThis inhalation capsule is indicated as a once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\rPharmacology\rGlycopyrronium is a long-acting, specific antimuscarinic agent, in clinical medicine often called an anticholinergic. It has a similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle results in relaxation. The high potency and slow receptor dissociation found its clinical correlate in significant and long-acting bronchodilation in patients with COPD.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of one inhalation capsule once daily of the content of one 50 microgram capsule using the inhalation device. This should be administered once daily every day at the same time of the day by orally inhaled route. For a missed dose, the next dose should be taken, as soon as it is remembered. This inhalation capsule should not be taken more than one time every 24 hours.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo specific interaction studies were conducted for the co-administration of this inhalation capsule with inhaled anti-cholinergic drugs and is therefore, like for other anticholinergics, not recommended. Although no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, this inhalation capsule has been used concomitantly with other drugs commonly used in the treatment of COPD without clinical evidence of drug interactions. These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids. Concomitant administration of this inhalation capsule and orally inhaled indacaterol, a (32 adrenergic agonist, under steady-state conditions of both drugs does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to glycopyrronium or to any of the excipients of the preparation.\rSide Effects\rThe common side effects experienced are dry mouth, cough, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, neck pain, diabetes mellitus, gastroenteritis, insomnia. Some side effects may result in fewer instances such as paradoxical bronchospasm, dysphonia, angioedema, hypersensitivity, pruritus, sinus congestion, throat irritation. In elderly patients above 75 years of age, the frequencies of urinary tract infection and headache is common.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: There is no adequate or well-controlled studies of the use of inhalation capsule in pregnant women with COPD available. Therefore, inhalation capsule should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: It is not known whether Glycopyrronium Bromide and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. Therefore, the use of inhalation capsule by breast-feeding women should be done with caution, and only be considered if the expected benefit to the woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant.\r Fertility: Reproduction studies and other data in animals do not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either males or females.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThis inhalation capsule is a once daily long term maintenance treatment and it is not indicated for the treatment of acute cases of bronchospasm i.e. as a rescue therapy.\r This inhalation capsule should not be used in patients under 18 years of age.\r Like other anticholinergic drugs, this inhalation capsule should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention. If signs suggesting any allergic reaction occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing and swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips and face), urticaria or skin rash, this inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. As with other inhalation therapy, administration of this inhalation capsule may result in paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, this inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.\r For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) including those with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, this inhalation capsule should only be used if only the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk.\rOverdose Effects\rHigh doses of Seebri may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms for which, symptomatic treatment may be indicated. In COPD patients, repeated orally inhaled administration of Seebri at total doses of 100 and 200 microgram once daily for 28 days is well tolerated. Acute intoxication by inadvertent oral ingestion of glycopyrronium capsules is unlikely.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator\rStorage Conditions\rThis capsule must not be swallowed. Only to be used with an inhalation device. Insert the Easycap in the Easyhaler for best performance. Remove this capsule from the blister pack immediately before using, as this capsule exposed to moisture may not tear easily. Store at a temperature not exceeding 30°C in a dry place.

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDoxiva should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Doxiva together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\r  INDICATIONS\r Salbutamol is indicated as a bronchodilator for use in -\r Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema and other conditions associated with airways obstruction.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Children\r2 - 6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults\r2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Windel Respirator Solution\rTo be used with a suitable nebuliser device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method 1 - Intermittent Administration:\r Adults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml - 1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical\rdirection in hospital. 0.5 - 1ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2 - 4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It\rwill take time about 10 minutes.\r Salbutmol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in\rthe nebuliser and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r Children under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0 - 4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however\rrequire higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r Method 2- Continuous administration:\r 1 - 2 ml solution is diluted to made up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable\rnebuliser devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Windel nebuliser solution\rTo be used with a suitable nebuliser device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in\rhospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. Higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Salbutamol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia,\rtenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Salbutamol should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders,\rhypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Salbutamol may result in increased susceptibility to\rdigitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary\rwhen treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed-angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r In pregnancy\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.\rIn lactation\rIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in\rsome animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the\rimportance of the drug to the mother.\r  OVER DOSE\r The symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with\rSalbutamol is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a\rhistory of bronchospasm.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Windel 2 tablet: Each box containing 20 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rWindel 4 tablet: Each box containing 20 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rWindel syrup: Each amber glass bottle contains 100 ml syrup.\rWindel Respirator solution: Each bottle contains 20 ml solution.\rWindel nebuliser solution: Each box contains 10 ampoules in blister packs.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nWindel 2 tablet: Each tablet contains Salbutamol Sulphate BP equivalent to 2 mg Salbutamol.\r\n \nWindel syrup: Each 5 ml contains Salbutamol Sulphate BP equivalent to 2 mg Salbutamol.\r\n \nWindel respirator solution: Each 1 ml solution contains Salbutamol Sulphate BP equivalent to Sulbutamol 5 mg.

Although structurally related to morphine, it has no analgesic properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Addiction has not been observed after the administration of rather large doses for prolonged period. It is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and exerts its effects in 15-30 minutes after oral administration. The duration of action is approximately 3-6 hours with conventional dosage form. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is extensively metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine as unchanged Dextromethorphan and demethylated metabolites including Dextrophan which has some cough suppressant activity. Urinary excretion of parent and metabolites accounts for up to 50% of the ingested dose over 24 hours. About 8% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine over the first 6 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and Children over 12 years: 15 to 30 mg three to four times per day. However, 60 mg doses up to four times per day have been used without increased side effects.\r Children between 6 and 12 years: 5-15 mg up to four times per day.\r Children between 2 and 6 years: 2.5-5 mg up to four times per day.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTwo fatal interactions have been reported in patients taking therapeutic doses of phenelzine and dextromethorphan.\rContraindications\rConcomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated with Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolised in the liver and should be prescribed with caution to patients with liver disease.\rSide Effects\rAdverse effects with Tomephen are rare, but nausea and dizziness sometimes occur. The drug produces no analgesia or addiction and little or no CNS depression. Excitation, confusion and respiratory depression may occur after overdosage.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information on the use of this drug in pregnancy and therefore it should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy. No information is available on secretion of dextromethorphan into breast milk, so nursing mothers should be advised not to take the drug.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDo not use Tomephen to control a cough that is associated with smoking, asthma, or emphysema, or a cough that is productive (produces sputum or phlegm).\rTherapeutic Class\rCough suppressant\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It has a similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle results in relaxation. The high potency and slow receptor dissociation found its clinical correlate in significant and long-acting bronchodilation in patients with COPD.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of one inhalation capsule once daily of the content of one 50 microgram capsule using the inhalation device. This should be administered once daily every day at the same time of the day by orally inhaled route. For a missed dose, the next dose should be taken, as soon as it is remembered.

Although no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, this inhalation capsule has been used concomitantly with other drugs commonly used in the treatment of COPD without clinical evidence of drug interactions. These include sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids. Concomitant administration of this inhalation capsule and orally inhaled indacaterol, a (32 adrenergic agonist, under steady-state conditions of both drugs does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to glycopyrronium or to any of the excipients of the preparation.\rSide Effects\rThe common side effects experienced are dry mouth, cough, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, neck pain, diabetes mellitus, gastroenteritis, insomnia. Some side effects may result in fewer instances such as paradoxical bronchospasm, dysphonia, angioedema, hypersensitivity, pruritus, sinus congestion, throat irritation. In elderly patients above 75 years of age, the frequencies of urinary tract infection and headache is common.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: There is no adequate or well-controlled studies of the use of inhalation capsule in pregnant women with COPD available. Therefore, inhalation capsule should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: It is not known whether Glycopyrronium Bromide and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. Therefore, the use of inhalation capsule by breast-feeding women should be done with caution, and only be considered if the expected benefit to the woman is greater than any possible risk to the infant.\r Fertility: Reproduction studies and other data in animals do not indicate a concern regarding fertility in either males or females.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThis inhalation capsule is a once daily long term maintenance treatment and it is not indicated for the treatment of acute cases of bronchospasm i.e. as a rescue therapy.\r This inhalation capsule should not be used in patients under 18 years of age.\r Like other anticholinergic drugs, this inhalation capsule should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention. If signs suggesting any allergic reaction occur, in particular, angioedema (including difficulties in breathing and swallowing, swelling of the tongue, lips and face), urticaria or skin rash, this inhalation capsule should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.

Phenylephrine HCI BP 10 mg & Triprolidine HCI BP 2.5 mg.\r Description\r Sudokof Antitussive syrup is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agents.\r Dextromethorphan is used to suppress dry cough. Dextromethorphan is safe, effective and non-narcotic\r antitussive. It blocks the cough reflex in situations where the dry cough serves no purpose. It does so by\r calming the cough centre of the brain that governs the coughing reflex. Dextromethorphan does not induce tolerance, and has no potential for addiction like opiates Phenylephrine acts by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors. Phenylephrine acts on receptors in the muscles of the blood vessel walls, causing them to contract. This results in narrowing of the blood vessels and decreased blood flow in the lining of the nose and sinuses. Thus fluid congestion in the nose and\r sinuses is reduced. Triprolidine is a strong antihistamine, which acts on histamine-1 (H) receptor. It blocks histamine, preventing dilatation of blood vessels, reducing redness and swelling It may\r drowsiness.\r Indications and Uses\r the action of\r cause mild\r Sudokof, the combination of Dextromethorphan, Phenylephrine & Triprolidine is used to relieve the\r symptoms of colds and flu, runny nose, nasal congestion and cough, where these are associated with dry\r cough Dosage and Administration\r Age\r Dose\r Adults and Children over 12 years\r 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) 4 times in a day\r 6-12 years of age\r ½ teaspoonful (2.5 mi) 4 times in a day\r Side effects \rFew side effects to be associated with this medicine are known such as rash, disturbed sleep, drowsiness disturbances of the gut such as danhoes, constipation, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, dry mouth, nose and throat are occasionally reported\r Contraindication This combination is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Dextromethorphan\r Phenylephrine or Triprolidine Contraindicated in persons under treatment with monoamine oxidase\r inhibitors within 2 weeks of stopping such treatment.

Dextromethorphan is safe, effective and non-narcotic\r\n \nantitussive. It blocks the cough reflex in situations where the dry cough serves no purpose. It does so by\r\n \ncalming the cough centre of the brain that governs the coughing reflex. Dextromethorphan does not induce tolerance, and has no potential for addiction like opiates Phenylephrine acts by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors. Phenylephrine acts on receptors in the muscles of the blood vessel walls, causing them to contract. This results in narrowing of the blood vessels and decreased blood flow in the lining of the nose and sinuses. Thus fluid congestion in the nose and\r\n \nsinuses is reduced. Triprolidine is a strong antihistamine, which acts on histamine-1 (H) receptor. It blocks histamine, preventing dilatation of blood vessels, reducing redness and swelling It may\r\n \ndrowsiness.\r\n \nIndications and Uses\r\n \nthe action of\r\n \ncause mild\r\n \nSudokof, the combination of Dextromethorphan, Phenylephrine & Triprolidine is used to relieve the\r\n \nsymptoms of colds and flu, runny nose, nasal congestion and cough, where these are associated with dry\r\n \ncough Dosage and Administration\r\n \nAge\r\n \nDose\r\n \nAdults and Children over 12 years\r\n \n1 teaspoonful (5 ml) 4 times in a day\r\n \n6-12 years of age\r\n \n½ teaspoonful (2.5 mi) 4 times in a day\r\n \nSide effects \r\nFew side effects to be associated with this medicine are known such as rash, disturbed sleep, drowsiness disturbances of the gut such as danhoes, constipation, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, dry mouth, nose and throat are occasionally reported\r\n \nContraindication This combination is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Dextromethorphan\r\n \nPhenylephrine or Triprolidine Contraindicated in persons under treatment with monoamine oxidase\r\n \ninhibitors within 2 weeks of stopping such treatment.

In the event of serious poisoning, the stomach should be emptied and, if necessary, a beta-blocker administered with\rcaution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r   COMMERCIAL PACK\r Purisal 1 tablet: Each box containing 10 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rPurisal 2 tablet: Each box containing 10 blister strips of 10 tablets.\rPurisal 50 ml syrup: Each amber glass bottle contains 50 ml syrup.\rPurisal 100 ml syrup: Each amber glass bottle contains 100 ml syrup\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nPurisal 1: Each tablet contains Levosalbutamol Sulphate INN equivalent to Levosalbutamol 1 mg.\r\n \nPurisal 2: Each tablet contains Levosalbutamol Sulphate INN equivalent to Levosalbutamol 2 mg.\r\n \nPurisal syrup: Each 5 ml syrup contains Levosalbutamol Sulphate INN equivalent to Levosalbutamol 1 mg.\r\n \n \n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nLevosalbutamol is a single isomer beta-2 agonist that differs from racemic salbutamol by elimination of (S)-salbutamol.\r\nLevosalbutamol is an effective bronchodilator whose primary mechanism of action is unimpeded by (S)-salbutamol.Thus, when compared\r\nwith racemic salbutamol, clinically comparable bronchodilation can be achieved with doses that substantially lessen beta-mediated\r\nside effects. Levosalbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth\r\nmuscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibres.\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nLevosalbutamol is indicated for the treatment and prevention of bronchospasm in adults, adolescents, and children 6 years of age\r\nand older with reversible obstructive airway diseases.\r\n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \nChildren (2 -5 years): Up to 0.1 mg/kg body weight (not more than 1 mg) three times daily.\r\nChildren (6 -11 years): 5 ml (1 mg), three times daily.\r\nAdults and adolescents above 12 years: 1-2 mg, three times daily.\r\n \n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nHypocalcaemia, palpitation, fine tremors of the skeletal muscle and muscle cramps may occur. The other likely side effects are\r\nnausea, vomiting, burning substernal or epigastric pain and diarrhoea.\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nParticular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by hypoxia and by concomitant treatment\r\nwith xanthine derivatives, steroids and diuretics. Serum potassium levels should be monitored in such situations.\r\n \n \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r\n \nPregnancy: The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.\r\nLactation: It is not known whether levosalbutamol is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when oral levosalbutamol\r\nis administered to a nursing woman.\r\n \n \n \nDRUG INTERACTION\r\n \nOther short-acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine should be used with caution with levosalbutamol. If additional\r\nadrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular\r\neffects.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nThe expected symptoms with over dosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and the symptoms listed under side\r\neffects.

        "description": "Indications\rConsucon MR is a medicine that reduces blood sugar levels (oral antidiabetic medicine belonging to the sulphonylurea group). Consucon MR is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.\rPharmacology\rGliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca+2  transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.\rDosage & Administration\rFilm-coated tablet: The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes.\r Modified release preparation: Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses.\r The recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s).\r If a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.\r If you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should: If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency.\r If you forget to take Gliclazide tablet: It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\r If you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet: As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rOther medicines and Consucon MR: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\r The blood sugar lowering effect of Consucon MR may be strengthened and signs of low blood sugar levels may occur when one of the follow ng medicines is taken:\rother medicines used to treat high blood sugar (oral antidiabetics, GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin),\rantibiotics (sulphonamides, clarithromycin)\rmedicines to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (beta-blockers. ACE-inhibitors such as captopril, or enalapril)\rmedicines to treat fungal infections (miconazole, fluconazole)\rmedicines to treat ulcers in the stomach or duodenum (H2 receptor antagonists),\rmedicines to treat depression (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)\rpainkiller or antirheumatics (phenylbutazone, ibuprofen)\rmedicines containing alcohol\rThe blood-glucose-lowering effect of Consucon MR may be weakened and raised blood sugar levels may occur when one of the following medicines is taken:\rmedicines to treat disorders of the central nervous system (chlorpromazine)\rmedicines reducing inflammation (corticosteroids)\rmedicines to treat asthma or used during labour (intravenous salbutamol, ritodrine and terbutaline)\rmedicines to treat breast disorders, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis (danazol)\rSt John's Wort- Hypericum perforatum- preparations\rBlood glucose disturbance (low blood sugar and high blood sugar) can occur when a medicine belonging to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones is taken at the same time as Consucon MR especially in elderly patients.\r Consucon MR may increase the effects of medicines that reduce blood clotting (warfarin).\r Consult your doctor before you start taking another medicinal product. If you go into hospital tell the medical staff you are taking Consucon MR.\r Consucon MR with food and drink: Consucon MR can be taken with food and non-alcoholic drinks. Drinking alcohol is not recommended as it can alter the control of your diabetes in an unpredictable manner.\r Driving and using machines: Your ability to concentrate or react may be impaired if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), or too high (hyperglycaemia) or if you develop visual problems as a result of such conditions. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others (for instance when driving a car or using machines). Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car if you:\rhave frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\rhave few or no warning signals of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\rConsucon MR contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\rContraindications\rDo not take Gliclazide:\rif you are allergic to gliclazide or to other medicines of the same group (sulfonylurea), or to other related medicines (hypoglycaemic sulfonamides)\rif you have insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1)\rif you have ketone bodies and sugar in your urine (this may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis), a diabetic pre-coma or coma\rif you have severe kidney or liver disease\rif you are taking medicines to treat fungal infections\rif you are breastfeeding\rSide Effects\rLike all medicines, Consucon MR can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention.\r Liver disorders: There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment.\r Skin disorders: Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature.\r Blood disorders: Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued.\r Digestive disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Consucon MR is taken with a meal as recommended.\r Eye disorders: Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels.\r As for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed: cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases.\r Reporting of side effects: If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rGliclazide is not recommended for use during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. You must not take Gliclazide while you are breastfeeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTalk to your doctor before taking Consucon MR. You should observe the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to achieve proper blood sugar levels. This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Consucon MR treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased.

It works by supporting your body in controlling blood sugar levels in two ways. First, it encourages your pancreas to release more insulin. Second, it improves your body's ability to use the insulin it already has. Thus it lowers your blood sugar levels.\rWhat happens if I take Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet without eating?\rConsucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet dosage is tied to your meals. It should be skipped if you miss a meal. If you plan to eat an extra meal, talk to your doctor about adjusting your dose for that day.\rWhat if I missed a dose of Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet?\rThe missed dose can be taken as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Do not take two doses together to make up for a missed dose.\rHow long does the effect of Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet last?\rThe effect of this medicine lasts for an average duration of 24 hours.\rAre there any pregnancy warnings for Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet?\rThis medicine is not recommended for pregnant women.\rGeneral Instructions\rTake Consucon MR 30 mg MR Tablet as directed by your doctor. This includes the dose and how often you should take it.\rThe medicine should be taken by mouth (orally) 30 minutes before breakfast.\rYou should monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as directed by your doctor.\rAlways carry a sugary candy with you to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Consistent food intake reduces the risk of hypoglycemia.\nIndications\r\nConsucon MR is a medicine that reduces blood sugar levels (oral antidiabetic medicine belonging to the sulphonylurea group). Consucon MR is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.\r\nPharmacology\r\nGliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca+2  transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFilm-coated tablet: The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes.\r\n \nModified release preparation: Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses.\r\n \nThe recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s).\r\n \nIf a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist.\r\n \nIf you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should: If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency.\r\n \nIf you forget to take Gliclazide tablet: It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\r\n \nIf you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet: As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nOther medicines and Consucon MR: Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.\r\n \nThe blood sugar lowering effect of Consucon MR may be strengthened and signs of low blood sugar levels may occur when one of the follow ng medicines is taken:\r\nother medicines used to treat high blood sugar (oral antidiabetics, GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin),\r\nantibiotics (sulphonamides, clarithromycin)\r\nmedicines to treat high blood pressure or heart failure (beta-blockers. ACE-inhibitors such as captopril, or enalapril)\r\nmedicines to treat fungal infections (miconazole, fluconazole)\r\nmedicines to treat ulcers in the stomach or duodenum (H2 receptor antagonists),\r\nmedicines to treat depression (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)\r\npainkiller or antirheumatics (phenylbutazone, ibuprofen)\r\nmedicines containing alcohol\r\nThe blood-glucose-lowering effect of Consucon MR may be weakened and raised blood sugar levels may occur when one of the following medicines is taken:\r\nmedicines to treat disorders of the central nervous system (chlorpromazine)\r\nmedicines reducing inflammation (corticosteroids)\r\nmedicines to treat asthma or used during labour (intravenous salbutamol, ritodrine and terbutaline)\r\nmedicines to treat breast disorders, heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis (danazol)\r\nSt John's Wort- Hypericum perforatum- preparations\r\nBlood glucose disturbance (low blood sugar and high blood sugar) can occur when a medicine belonging to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones is taken at the same time as Consucon MR especially in elderly patients.\r\n \nConsucon MR may increase the effects of medicines that reduce blood clotting (warfarin).\r\n \nConsult your doctor before you start taking another medicinal product. If you go into hospital tell the medical staff you are taking Consucon MR.\r\n \nConsucon MR with food and drink: Consucon MR can be taken with food and non-alcoholic drinks. Drinking alcohol is not recommended as it can alter the control of your diabetes in an unpredictable manner.\r\n \nDriving and using machines: Your ability to concentrate or react may be impaired if your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), or too high (hyperglycaemia) or if you develop visual problems as a result of such conditions. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or others (for instance when driving a car or using machines). Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car if you:\r\nhave frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\r\nhave few or no warning signals of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\r\nConsucon MR contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.\r\nContraindications\r\nDo not take Gliclazide:\r\nif you are allergic to gliclazide or to other medicines of the same group (sulfonylurea), or to other related medicines (hypoglycaemic sulfonamides)\r\nif you have insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1)\r\nif you have ketone bodies and sugar in your urine (this may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis), a diabetic pre-coma or coma\r\nif you have severe kidney or liver disease\r\nif you are taking medicines to treat fungal infections\r\nif you are breastfeeding\r\nSide Effects\r\nLike all medicines, Consucon MR can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention.\r\n \nLiver disorders: There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment.\r\n \nSkin disorders: Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature.\r\n \nBlood disorders: Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued.\r\n \nDigestive disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Consucon MR is taken with a meal as recommended.\r\n \nEye disorders: Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels.\r\n \nAs for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed: cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases.\r\n \nReporting of side effects: If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nGliclazide is not recommended for use during pregnancy.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity.

Its molecular formula is C11H14N4O4 and its molecular weight is 266.253 g/mol.\rDoxofylline is a new creation long lasting oral methylxanthine extract. Methylxanthines are from the family of phosphodiesterase\rinhibitors. Correspondingly, its system of activity is associated to the reticence of phosphodiesterase action, initiating in\rbronchodilating actions. It has a bronchodilator effect which reduces rate of breathlessness in patients suffering from asthma. It\rhelps relax the muscles in the bronchi and bronchioles, thus causing dilatation of the air passages and helping patients to\rbreathe easily. The drug also possesses antitussive properties which help to control the cough linked with lung disorders.\r  INDICATIONS\r Doxofylline is mostly administered for maintenance treatment in subjects experiencing COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)\rand bronchial asthma. Doxofylline is not designed for use as an emergency treatment during an asthma attack.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Tablet\rAdults: 400 mg sustained release tablet once a day. Single dose, administration in the evening reduces nocturnal, symptoms and\rhelps to keep the patients complaint free during the day. However, in certain cases, 400 mg tablet twice daily is recommended on\rthe basis of the clinical response and according to disease severity.

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBrezofil should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Brezofil together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children. Brezofil should be used only on prescription of specialist physician.\r\nIndications\r\nBrezofil is used to treat in following indications: \r\nBronchial asthma,\r\nBronchospasm,\r\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\r\nPulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nDoxophylline is a novel bronchodilator.

No evidence of a relationship between Doxofylline serum concentrations and toxic events have been\r\nreported.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nAlthough no major arrhythmias have been documented with Doxofylline, the occurrence of major cardiac rhythm disturbances cannot be\r\nexcluded in case of overdosage of xanthine compounds. If a potential oral overdose is established, the patient may present with\r\nseizures; this symptom could be the first sign of intoxication. Adverse reactions may cause withdrawal from treatment.\r\n \n \nSTORAGE\r\n \n- Store at room temperature (not exceeding 25°C).\r\n- Store in cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\n \n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nBrezofil: Each box contains 3 blister strips of 10 tablets.",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.\rM-lucas - MedEx campaign banner\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rAdults and adolescents with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis: \rThe dosage for adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: Montelukast 10 mg tablet once daily.\rPediatric patients with asthma or seasonal allergic rhinitis:\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: Montelukast 5 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 2 years to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg tablet once daily.\rThe dosage for pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age: Montelukast 4 mg oral granules once daily.

In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of M-Kast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, M-Kast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the AUC of M-Kast approximately 40% following a single 10mg dose of M-Kast. No dosage adjustment for M-Kast is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with M-Kast.\rContraindications\rMontelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rCommon: Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection.\r Uncommon: Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders.\r Rare: Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rMontelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast  is given to a nursing mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rM-Kast is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with M-Kast can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, M-Kast should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. M-Kast should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking M-Kast. Although M-Kast is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.\rOverdose Effects\rThere were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of M-Kast and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.

        "description": "Indications\rTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rDescription\rThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\rPharmacology\rBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\rDosage\rInhaler (For Asthma)-\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\rInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\rAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\rChildren (4 years and older):\rMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\rReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\rInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily.

If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r Following simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\rTake off the cap.\rShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\rIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\rBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\rPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\rWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\rRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\rIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\rAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\rCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\rInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\rContraindications\rThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\rPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\rHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:\r Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism.

Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.\r Budesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rFor this combination or the concomitant treatment with Formoterol and Budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. Data from an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the combination.There are no adequate data from use of Formoterol in pregnant women. In animal studies Formoterol has caused adverse effects in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether Formoterol passes into human breast milk. In rats, small amounts of Formoterol have been detected in maternal milk. Administration of this combination to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCaution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism. Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.\rUse in Special Populations\rIt is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist.\rOverdose Effects\rAn overdose of Formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for (32 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, headache, palpitations. Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Supportive and symptomatic treatment may be indicated. A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. Acute overdosage with Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. When used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, may appear.\rStorage Conditions\rInhalation capsules must not be swallowed. Only to be used with inhalation device. Keep away from light and wet place. Store at or below 25°C temperature. Keep out of reach of children. Remove Inhalation capsule from the blister pack only immediately before use it in the inhalation device as Inhalation capsule exposed to moisture may not be pierced easily.\nIndications\r\nTreatment of Asthma: This inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. This is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\r\n \nMaintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This inhalation capsule is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This inhalation capsule is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nDescription\r\nThis inhalation capsule is used for dry powder inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalation only. It is a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations. Inhaled Budesonide has less severe adverse effects than systemic corticosteroids.The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction. The bronchodilating effect is dose-dependent, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes. The duration of effect is at least 12 hours after a single dose.\r\nPharmacology\r\nBudesonide: It is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.\r\n \nFormoterol Fumarate Dihydrate: It is a long-acting, selective β2 - adrenergic agonist with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP acts locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs are attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from the cells, especially from mast cells.\r\nDosage\r\nInhaler (For Asthma)-\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older): The recommended maintenance dose is 1 puff twice daily or 2 puffs once daily. For some patients a maintenance dose of 2 puffs twice daily may be appropriate (for 160/4.5 mcg/inhalation only). Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 6 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nChildren: The usual maintenance dose is 1 -2 puffs once or twice daily. Patients should take 1 additional puff as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, the additional puff should be taken. Not more than 4 puffs should be taken on any single occasion.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For Asthma): There are two alternative dosage regimens for the treatment of asthma with Budesonide and Formoterol combination. Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule maintenance and reliever therapy.\r\nAdults and adolescents (12 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 & 200 Inhalation Capsule twice daily\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 6 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 8 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 12 Inhalation Capsule can be used temporarily.\r\nChildren (4 years and older):\r\nMaintenance dose: Budesonide and Formoterol 100 Inhalation Capsule once daily.\r\nReliever dose: 1 additional Inhalation Capsule as needed in response to symptoms. If symptoms persist after a few minutes, an additional Inhalation Capsule should be taken. Not more than 4 Inhalation Capsule should be taken on any single occasion. A total daily dose of more than 4 Inhalation Capsule is not normally needed, however, a total daily dose of up to 8 Inhalation Capsule could be used temporarily.\r\nInhalation Capsule (For COPD): Adults (40 years and older)\r\n200 Inhalation Capsule: 2 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 4 Inhalation Capsule\r\n400 Inhalation Capsule: 1 Inhalation Capsule twice daily. Maximum daily maintenance dose: 2 Inhalation Capsule.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nUsing an Inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not know how to use it in the right way. If the Inhaler is used in the wrong way, less medicine can reach the lungs. Correct and regular use of the Inhaler will prevent or lessen the severity of asthma attacks.\r\n \nFollowing simple steps can help to use Inhaler effectively (According to \"National Asthma Guidelines for Medical Practitioners\" published by Asthma Association):\r\nTake off the cap.\r\nShake the inhaler (at least six times) vigorously before each use.\r\nIf the inhaler is new or if it has not been used for a week or more, shake it well and release one puff into the air to make sure that it works.\r\nBreathe out as full as comfortably possible & hold the inhaler upright.\r\nPlace the actuator into mouth between the teeth and close lips around the mouthpiece.\r\nWhile breathing deeply and slowly through the mouth, press down firmly add fully on the canister to release medicine.\r\nRemove the inhaler from mouth. Continue holding breath for at least for 10 seconds or as long as it is comfortable.\r\nIf doctor has prescribed more than one inhalation per treatment, wait 1 minute between puffs (inhalations). Shake the inhaler well and repeat steps 4 to 7.\r\nAfter use, replace the cap on the mouthpiece. After each treatment, rinse mouth with water.\r\nCheck your technique in front of a mirror from time to time, if you see a white mist during the inhalation, you may not have closed your lips properly around mouthpiece, or you may not be breathing in as you press the can. This indicates failure of technique. If this happens, repeat the procedure from step 4 carefully.\r\nInstructions for Cleaning Inhaler: Clean your Inhaler at least once a week. Remove canister and rinse the plastic actuator and cap in warm water but do not put the metal canister into water. Dry the actuator and cap thoroughly and gently replace the metal canister into the actuator with a twisting motion. Put the cap on the mouthpiece.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium- sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.\r\nContraindications\r\nThis is contraindicated in the following conditions-\r\nPrimary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.\r\nHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this preparation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds.

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDocopa should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Docopa together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children. Docopa should be used only on prescription of specialist physician.\nIndications\r\nDocopa is used to treat in following indications: \r\nBronchial asthma,\r\nBronchospasm,\r\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\r\nPulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nDoxophylline is a novel bronchodilator. It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r\n \nAdults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r\n \nChildren:\r\n>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r\n6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r\nIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nDocopa should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Docopa together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\r\nContraindications\r\nDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\r\nSide Effects\r\nPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r\n \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r\n \nCaution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults & Children over 12 years: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) 4 times a day every 4 hours interval.\r 6-12 years: 1/2 teaspoonful 4 times a day every 4 hours interval.\r Use in children and adolescents: A physician's advice should be obtained before administering this combination to children less than 6 years.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTaking certain MAO inhibitors with this medication may cause a serious (possibly fatal) drug interaction.

It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity.

In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nAverage daily dose (preferably after meal):\r\n \nPediatric Drops:\r\n0-6 months: 0.5 ml 2 times a day\r\n6-12 months: 1 ml 2 times a day\r\n1-2 years: 1.25 ml 2 times a day\r\nSyrup:\r\n2-5 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) 2-3 times a day\r\n5-10 years: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) 2-3 times a day\r\n10 years and adults: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 3 times a day.\r\nSustained release capsule: Adult and children over 12 years old: 1 capsule once daily.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nMyrox should not be taken simultaneously with antitussives (e.g.Codeine) because phlegm, which has been liquefied by Myrox might not be expectorated.\r\nContraindications\r\nContraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Ambroxol or Bromhexine.\r\nSide Effects\r\nGastrointestinal side effects like epigastric pain, stomach overfill feeling may occur occasionally. Rarely allergic responses such as eruption, urticaria or angioneurotic edema have been reported.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nTeratogenic and fetal toxicity studies have shown no harmful effect of Ambroxol. However, it is advised not to use it in pregnancy, especially during the1st trimester. Safety during lactation has not been established yet.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nMyrox should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders. Patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency should take it with caution.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCough expectorants & mucolytics\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nProtect from direct light exposure, Store in a dry place at a temperature not exceeding 30°C, Keep out of the reach of children.",

It structurally differs from Theophylline due to the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. Doxophylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4 thereby relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. However, differently from Theophylline, Doxophylline appears to have decreased affinities toward adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, which may account for the better safety profile of the drug. Doxophylline is reported to inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\rDosage & Administration\rElderly: 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r Adults: 400 mg tablet two or three times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r Children:\r>12 years of age: 10 ml syrup or 200 mg tablet two or three times daily.\r6-12 years of age: 6-9 mg/kg body weight two times daily, i.e. if body weight is 10 kg, 3 ml (60 mg) two times daily or as prescribed by the physician.\rIf required daily dose of Doxophylline is 400 mg then Doxophylline SR tablet to be taken once daily or as prescribed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rDoximar should not be administered with other xanthine preparations. It is recommended to limit consumption of beverages and food containing caffeine. Caution should be exercised in administering Doximar together with ephedrine or other sympathomimetic drugs. The concurrent administration of many drugs such as erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with an increase in the plasmatic levels of the drug. Phenytoin, other anticonvulsants and cigarette smoking may increase the clearance of xanthine derivatives with a reduction of plasmatic half-life. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the drug.\rContraindications\rDoxophylline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other xanthine derivatives. It is also contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and during lactation.\rSide Effects\rPatients treated with xanthine derivatives may suffer nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, headache, irritability, insomnia, tachycardia, extrasystoles, tachypnea and in rare cases hyperglycemia or albuminuria. In case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician's discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy and Lactation: Animal tests have shown that the active ingredient of Doxophylline does not interfere with pre and postnatal growth. However, as there is not sufficient clinical evidence about the effects of the drug during pregnancy, use of the drug during pregnancy should be evaluated carefully case by case on the basis of the risk-benefit ratio. The drug is contraindicated during lactation.\r Effects on ability to drive and use machines: The product does not affect the patient's alertness and therefore does not interfere with his/her ability to drive and use machines.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rNumerous factors may reduce the hepatic clearance of xanthine derivatives with increased plasma levels of the drug. These factors include age, congestive cardiac decompensation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease, concomitant infections, and the concurrent administration of several drugs such as: erythromycin, TAO, lincomycin, clindamycin, allopurinol, cimetidine, influenza vaccine and propanolol. In these cases, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of the drug. In case of factors that may influence the clearance of xanthine derivatives, monitoring of the concentration of the blood levels of the drug is recommended for the control of the therapeutic range.\r Caution should be taken in administering the product to patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, in the elderly, in patients with severe hypoxemia, hyperthyroidism, chronic corpulmonale, congestive heart failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer and in those with renal impairment. In particular, it is to be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, since the clearance of the drug is considerably slower in these patients in which high blood levels may persist for long periods even after discontinuation of the treatment. There is no risk of addiction or any other form of dependence.\rOverdose Effects\rIn case of overdose severe cardiac arrhythmias and tonic-clonic seizure may occur. These effects may represent the first signs of intoxication. The appearance of side effects may require discontinuation of the treatment which, if necessary, at the physician’s discretion, may be resumed at lower doses after all signs and symptoms of toxicity have subsided. As there is no specific antidote, in case of overdose a symptomatic treatment of cardiovascular collapse should be instituted.\rTherapeutic Class\rBronchodilator, Methyl xanthine derivatives\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

Salbutamol produces bronchodilatation through stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscles, thereby causing relaxation of bronchial muscle fibers. This action is manifested by an improvement in pulmonary function as demonstrated by spirometric measurements.\rDosage & Administration\rSalbutamol tablet or syrup-\rChildren:\r2-6 years: 2.5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\r6-12 years: 5 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily\rOver 12 years: 5-10 ml syrup, 3-4 times daily (2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily)\rAdults: 2-4 mg tablet, 3-4 times daily. Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet.\r Salbutamol Respirator Solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r Method-1 (Intermittent Administration):\rAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\rSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\rChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\rMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r Salbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\rAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\rChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\rSalbutamol injection:\rAdults:\rSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\rThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\rInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\rAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\rAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\rChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\rAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\rChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\rExcercise-induced Asthma:\rAdults: 400 microgram\rChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rSide Effects\rBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\rOverdose Effects\rThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Brodil is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\rTherapeutic Class\rShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\n \nMethod-1 (Intermittent Administration):\r\nAdults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes.\r\nSalbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes.\r\nChildren under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day.\r\nMethod-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.\r\n \nSalbutamol nebulizer solution: To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested.\r\nAdults & Elderly: 2.5 mg to 5 mg Salbutamol up to 4 times a day. Up to 40 mg/day may be given under strict medical direction in the hospital.\r\nChildren under 12 years: 2.5 mg up to 4 times a day. A higher dose up to 5 mg four times a day may be used if required.\r\nSalbutamol injection:\r\nAdults:\r\nSalbutamol I.V. infusion solution is used to prepare a solution for continuous intravenous infusion. It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Brodil is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL.\r\nThe only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection.\r\nInfusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary.\r\nAs with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration.\r\nAll unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation.\r\nChildren and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children.\r\n \nSalbutamol Inhalation Capsule:\r\nAdults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm.\r\nChildren: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours. Such patients should be warned not to increase the dose of inhaler, but should seek medical advice immediately.\r\nExcercise-induced Asthma:\r\nAdults: 400 microgram\r\nChild: 200 microgram, 15-30 minutes prior to any physical exertion.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nSide Effects\r\nBrodil may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscles (particularly the hands), palpitations and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential of tumorigenecity shown for Salbutamol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nBrodil should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive vascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Brodil may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Tachyphylaxis with resistance may occur with prolonged use of high dosage. Care is necessary when treating patients with diabetes mellitus or closed angle glaucoma, and in those receiving antihypertensive therapy.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThe symptoms with overdosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preferred antidote for overdosage with Brodil is a cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nShort-acting selective & β2-adrenoceptor stimulants\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.",

It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity. Ambroxol has anti inflammatory properties owing to the inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.\rDosage & Administration\rAverage daily dose (preferably after meal):\r Pediatric Drops:\r0-6 months: 0.5 ml 2 times a day\r6-12 months: 1 ml 2 times a day\r1-2 years: 1.25 ml 2 times a day\rSyrup:\r2-5 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) 2-3 times a day\r5-10 years: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) 2-3 times a day\r10 years and adults: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 3 times a day.\rSustained release capsule: Adult and children over 12 years old: 1 capsule once daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rLytex should not be taken simultaneously with antitussives (e.g.Codeine) because phlegm, which has been liquefied by Lytex might not be expectorated.\rContraindications\rContraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Ambroxol or Bromhexine.\rSide Effects\rGastrointestinal side effects like epigastric pain, stomach overfill feeling may occur occasionally. Rarely allergic responses such as eruption, urticaria or angioneurotic edema have been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTeratogenic and fetal toxicity studies have shown no harmful effect of Ambroxol. However, it is advised not to use it in pregnancy, especially during the1st trimester. Safety during lactation has not been established yet.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLytex should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders.

        "description": "Indications\rTemporarily relieves these symptoms due to common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or other upper respiratory allergies:\rcough due to minor throat or bronchial irritation\rrunny nose\rsneezing\ritching of the nose or throat\ritchy, watery eyes\rnasal congestion\rreduces swelling of nasal passages\rPharmacology\rThis preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. It is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from inner ear. Triprolidine provides symptomatic relief in conditions believed to depend wholly or partly upon the triggered release of histamine. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness.\rDosage\rAdults & Children 12 years of age and older: 1 teaspoonful (5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 6 to under 12 years of age: ½ teaspoonful (2.5 ml) every 4 hours, or as directed by a doctor.\r Children 2 to 6 years: To be used with caution, and as advised by the physician for children aged 2 to 6 years.\r Children below 2 years old: Not to be used in children below 2 years old.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rTake with or without food. Take with food if it causes an upset stomach. Measure liquid doses carefully. Use the measuring device that comes with this medicine.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rTaking certain MAO inhibitors with this medication may cause a serious (possibly fatal) drug interaction. Avoid taking isocarboxazid, methylene blue, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine during treatment with this medication. Most MAO inhibitors should also not be taken for two weeks before treatment with this medication. Caution should be excercised while taking Ocof with antihistamines applied to the skin (such as diphenhydramine cream, ointment, spray), antispasmodics (e.g. atropine, belladonna alkaloids), beta blockers (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol), drugs for Parkinson’s disease (e.g. anticholinergics such as benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), guanethidine, certain inhaled anesthetics (e.g. halothane), methyldopa, reserpine, scopolamine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, desipramine), anti seizure drugs (e.g. carbamazepine), medicine for sleep or anxiety (e.g. alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem), muscle relaxants, narcotic pain relievers (e.g. codeine), psychiatric medicines (e.g. chlorpromazine, risperidone, amitriptyline, trazodone).\rContraindications\rIt should be avoided in patients with liver disease or asthmatic patients and is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or within 2 weeks from stopping such treatment, known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and during acute attacks of asthma. It is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease.\rSide Effects\rIt may cause drowsiness, dottiness and constipation. Other side effects that may occur include GIT discomfort. No apparent evidence of physical dependence of the morphine type. Other less common side effects may include transient hypertension, dry mouth, restlessness, palpitations, allergic reactions such as rashes, tightness of chest, thickening of bronchial secretions, toxic psychosis and blood dyscrasia.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAs with any other drugs, use in pregnancy and lactation is best avoided.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rOcof may cause drowsiness. If affected, do not drive motor vehicle or operate machinery. Avoid alcoholic drink while on this medication. Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, hepatic disease, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloro-duodenal obstruction or bladder neck obstruction, unless under the medical advice and supervision. If symptoms do not improve within one week or accompanied with high fever, consult a physician before continuing use.\rOverdose Effects\rIn cases of over dosage, hospital admission is strongly advised. Over dosage may produce respiratory depression, paranoid psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, and convulsion. Treatment should include emptying the stomach by aspiration or gastric lavage. Nervous stimulation and convulsions should be treated with a sedative such as diazepam intramuscularly. If marked excitation is present, a sedative such as diazepam or a short-acting barbiturate may be given.\r Severe over dosage of phenylephrine hydrochloride may produce hypertension and associated reflex bradycardia. Treatment measures include early gastric lavage and symptomatic and supportive measures. The hypertensive effects may be treated with an alpha-receptor blocking agent (such as phentolamine mesilate 6-10 mg) given intravenously, and the bradycardia treated with atropine, preferable only after the pressure has been controlled.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined cough suppressants\rStorage Conditions\rKeep out of the reach of children. Keep in a cool & dry place. Protect from light.\nIndications\r\nTemporarily relieves these symptoms due to common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or other upper respiratory allergies:\r\ncough due to minor throat or bronchial irritation\r\nrunny nose\r\nsneezing\r\nitching of the nose or throat\r\nitchy, watery eyes\r\nnasal congestion\r\nreduces swelling of nasal passages\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent.

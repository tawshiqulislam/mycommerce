        "description": "Indications\rThis is indicated in the treatment of topical bacterial infections. This is particularly effective in atopic, contact stasis and infections, eczematoid dermatitis, neurodermatitis, eczema, anogenital pruritus. It may also be useful as an adjunct in certain pyodermas, such as impetigo, during specific systemic antibiotic therapy for these infections.\rPharmacology\rBacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is active against many gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci, corynebacteria and Clostridia) and some gram-negative species (e.g. Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae). They are often found in combinations in topical preparations as broad spectrum antibacterial agents.\r Neomycin, an aminoglyoside with antimicrobial spectrum similar to gentamicin, binds to the 30S subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and thereby disrupting DNA synthesis. It is active against many gram negative aerobes and against some strains of staphylococci.\rDosage & Administration\rOintment: Before use, the area for application should be cleaned gently. Derbis such as pus or crusts should be removed from the affected area. Apply two to three times daily to the affected skin area.\r Dusting Powder: Antibiotic powder is a non- sterile dusting powder and used for superficial skin infections. A light dusting of the powder to be applied to the affected skin area upto 4 times daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rBacitracin Zinc: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with other nephrotoxic drugs. May enhance the action of neuromuscular-blocking agents.\r Neomycin Sulphate: Additive nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect with other aminoglycosides, bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin. Enhanced toxicity with potent diuretics. May impair the absorption of other drugs. May enhance the effect of acarbose. May enhance the effect of non-depolarising muscle relaxants. May antagonise the parasympathomimetic effect of neostigmine and pyridostigmine. May increase the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients receiving bisphosphonates. May alter INR when givenwithanticoagulants. May inactivate oral typhoid vaccine.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to any of its components.\rSide Effects\rNebanol is usually well tolerated. In rare cases, allergic reactions may be occurred.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe safe use of this preparation during pregnancy & lactation has not been established. Therefore it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBacitracin & Neomycin antibiotic powder should not be used to large open wounds or to severely injured skin or on areas that exude large volumes of fluid as hard crusts may form. Since this skin ointment contains Neomycin, it should not be used for the treatment of otitis external when the eardrum is perforated because of risk of ototoxicity.\r Patients considering self-medication with a topical anti-infective for deep or puncture wounds, animal bites, or serious burns should be advised to first consult a physician. Patients using the preparations for the prevention of infection in minor skin injuries (e.g., cuts, scrapes, burns) should be advised to discontinue the topical anti-infective preparation and consult a physician if the condition persists or worsens; it should not be used for longer than 1 week unless directed by a physician.\rUse in Special Populations\rChildren and Infants: This ointment is suitable for use in children at the same dose as adults, but the dose should be reduced in infants.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Cutaneous. Creams are especially appropriate for moist or weeping surfaces. Ointments are especially appropriate for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.\rContraindications\rRosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis. Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Xenovate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture. Do not freeze.

Keep out of the reach of children.\r\nIndications\r\nXenovate is indicated for adults, elderly and children over 1 year in following dermatoses.\r\nPsoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis)\r\nRecalcitrant dermatoses\r\nLichen planus\r\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus\r\nOther skin conditions which do not respond satisfactorily to less potent steroids\r\nComposition\r\nClobetasol Propionate Cream: Each gram cream contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate Ointment: Each gram ointment contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate Scalp Application: Each gram lotion contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate Shampoo: Each gram shampoo contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate Lotion: Each gram lotion contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate Spray: Each gram spray contains Clobetasol Propionate BP 0.5 mg (0.05% w/w).\r\nPharmacology\r\nClobetasol Propionate is a very potent topical corticosteroid. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\r\nDosage\r\nCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r\n \nSpray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r\n \nShampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r\n \nScalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Cutaneous. Creams are especially appropriate for moist or weeping surfaces. Ointments are especially appropriate for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.\r\nContraindications\r\nRosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis. Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\r\nHypersensitivity to the preparation.\r\nThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\r\nDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\r\nProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\r\nIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\r\nThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Xenovate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r\n \nIt is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r\n \nThe face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r\n \nIf applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r\n \nTopical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r\n \nAppropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Topical corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis ointment is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory manifestations of hyperkeratotic and dry corticosteroid responsive dermatoses such as, psoriasis, chronic atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis (licehen Simplex, Chronicus), lichen planus, eczema (including nummular eczema, hand eczema, eczematous dermatitis), seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, ichthyosis vulgaris and other ichthyotic conditions.\rPharmacology\rClobetasol Propionate high potency corticosteroid. Corticosteroids decrease inflammation by stabilizing leukocyte lysosomal membranes, preventing release of destructive acid hydrolases from leukocytes; inhibiting macrophage accumulation in inflamed areas; reducing leukocyte adhesion to capillary endothelium; reducing capillary wall permeability and edema formation; decreasing complement components; antagonizing histamine activity and release of kinin from substrates; and reducing fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and subsequent scar tissue formation.\r Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: Apply a thin layer of this ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently & completely. For some patients, adequate maintenance therapy may be achieved with less frequent application. As with other higher active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. It should not be used with occlusive dressing. Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not exceeding 50 gm/week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.\r Children: Use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere has been no report of interaction with Clobetasol Propionate ointment and cream. There are no known interactions of Salicylic Acid when used as indicated. However, topical salicylic acid may increase the absorption of other topically applied medicines. Concomitant use of Salicylic Acid Ointment and other topical medicines on the same area of skin should therefore be avoided.\rContraindications\rClobetasol Propionate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Clobetasol Propionate. This preparation is contraindicated also in the treatment of primary infected bacterial or fungal skin lesions if no anti-infective agent is used simultaneously, in primary cutaneous viral infections (i.e., herpes simplex, vaccinia and varicella) and in tuberculous skin lesions. Clobetasol Propionate is also contraindicated in dermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and diaper eruptions. Salicylic Acid is contraindicated in patients displaying salicylate hyersensitivity, or sensitivity to any other ingredient in the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amounts of Clobetasol Propionate or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. This effect is more likely to occur in infants and children, and if occlusive dressings are used. Local atrophy may occur after prolonged treatment. In rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the diseases. Clobetasol Propionate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Possible sensitivity reactions, drying and irritation when using Salicylic Acid.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTopical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of fetal development. The relevance of this finding to human beings has not been established. The safe use of Clobetasol Propionate during lactation has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively in pregnant patients in large amounts or for prolonged periods of time. Whilst there are no known contra-indications to the use of Salicylic Acid ointment during pregnancy and lactation, the safety has not been established. Salicylic Acid ointment shold therefore be used with caution.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rClobetasol Propionate should be used with caution on lesions close to the eye. When Clobetasol Propionate is used over extensive areas for prolonged periods, it is possible that sufficient absorption may take place to give rise to adrenal suppression. This is particularly true for pediatric patients who may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratio. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapases, development of tolearance, risk of generalisedpustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis, careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of antimicrobial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied. Avoid contact with broken or inflammed skin. Salicylate toxicity may occur if applied to large areas of skin or to the skin of neonates.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation topical steroids should be discontinued gradually. However, because of the risk of acute adrenal suppression this should be done under medical supervision. Symptoms osslystemic salicylate poisoning (tinnitus, dizziness and deafness) have been reported after the application of Salicylic Acid to large areas of skin and for prolonged periods. Salicylism may also occur in the unlikely event of large quantities being ingested. Salicylism is ullikely to occur if Salicylic Acid ointment is used as indicated. Salicylate poisoining is usually associated with plasma concentrations >350 mg/L. Most adult deaths occur in patients whose concentrations exceed 700 ml/L. Single doses less than 100 mg/kg are unlikely to cause serious poisoning.\rTherapeutic Class\rClobetasol / Clobetasone & Combined Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nThis ointment is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory manifestations of hyperkeratotic and dry corticosteroid responsive dermatoses such as, psoriasis, chronic atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis (licehen Simplex, Chronicus), lichen planus, eczema (including nummular eczema, hand eczema, eczematous dermatitis), seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, ichthyosis vulgaris and other ichthyotic conditions.\r\nPharmacology\r\nClobetasol Propionate high potency corticosteroid.

Yeast infections of the skin, principally those caused by the genus Candida (e.g. C. albicans). Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor due to Pityrosporum orbicular (also known as Malassezia furfur).\r Telfin 1% Spray: This spray is indicated in the treatment of tinea infections of the skin. This spray is also indicated in the treatment of pityriasis (tinea) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur.\rPharmacology\rTerbinafine, an Allylamine antifungal, inhibits biosynthesis of Ergosterol (an essential component of fungai cell membrane) via inhibition of Squalene Epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to the increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of Squalene but not due to Ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species test in vitro, Terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown. Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Tricophyton Mentagrophyte, Trichophyton Rubrum.\rDosage & Administration\rTerbinafine tablet:\rFor the treatment of fingernail onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg (one tablet), once daily for 6 weeks.\rFor the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg (one tablet), once daily for 12 weeks.\rThe optimal clinical effect is seen some months after mycological cure and cessation of treatment. This is related to the period required for the outgrowth of healthy nail.\rTerbinafine granules:\rBody Weight: <25 kg: 125 mg/day up to 6 weeks\rBody Weight: 25-35 kg: 187.5 mg/day up to 6 weeks\rBody Weight: >35 kg: 250 mg/day up to 6 weeks\rTerbinafine cream: Terbinafine cream can be applied once or twice daily. Cleanse and dry the affected areas thoroughly before application of the terbinafine cream. Apply the cream to the affected skin and the surrounding area in a thin layer and rub in lightly. In the case of intertriginous infections (submammary, interdigital, intergluteal, inguinal) the application may be covered with a gauze strip, especially at night. The likely durations of treatment are as follows:\rTinea corporis, cruris: 1 to 2 weeks\rTinea pedis: 1 week\rCutaneous candidiasis: 2 weeks\rPityriasis versicolor: 2 weeks\rRelief of the clinical symptoms usually occurs within a few days. Irregular use or premature discontinuation of treatment carries the risk of recurrence. If there are no signs of improvement after two weeks, the diagnosis should be verified.\r Terbinafine 1% Spray: This spray is applied once or twice daily, depending on the indication. The affected areas should be cleansed and dried thoroughly before application of this spray. A sufficient amount of solution should be applied to wet the treatment area(s) thoroughly.\rTinea pedis: once a day,1 week\rTinea corporis/cruris: once a day,1 week\rPityriasis versicolor: twice a day, 1 week\rRelief of clinical symptoms usually occurs within a few days. If there are no signs of improvement after two weeks the diagnosis should be verified.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIn vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Co-administration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug.\rContraindications\rTerbinafine tablet and cream are contra-indicated in individuals with hypersensitive to terbinafine.\rSide Effects\rThe adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Other adverse reactions that have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTerbinafine tablet: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because treatment of onychomycosis can be postponed until after pregnancy is completed, it is recommended that terbinafine not be initiated during pregnancy. After oral administration, terbinafine is present in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Treatment with terbinafine is not recommended in nursing mothers.\r Terbinafine cream: Foetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse effects. There is no clinical experience with terbinafine in pregnant women; therefore, unless the potential benefits outweigh any potential risk, terbinafine should not be administered. Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not receive terbinafine treatment whilst breast-feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWarnings-\rTelfin tablets: Rare cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets for the treatment of onychomycosis in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions and an uncertain causal association with terbinafine. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if there is biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury. There have been isolated reports of serious skin reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine should be discontinued.\rTelfin cream: Telfin cream is for external use only. Contact with the eyes should be avoided.\rPrecautions: Telfin are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Telfin, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Pretreatment serum transaminase (ALT and AST) teste are advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: The safety and efficacy of terbinafine have not been established in pediatric patients.\r Use in the elderly: There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients require different dosages or experience side-effects different to those of younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rClinical experience regarding overdose with terbinafine tablets is limited. Doses up to 5 gm (20 times the therapeutic daily dose) have been taken without inducing serious adverse reactions. The symptoms of overdose included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, frequent urination, and headache.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Antifungal preparations, Topical Antifungal preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, below 30°C, protect from light.\nIndications\r\nTelfin tablet: This tablet is indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).\r\n \nTelfin granules: This is indicated in Tinea Capitis.\r\n \nTelfin cream: Fungal infection of the skin caused by Trichophyton (e.g. T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. verrucosum, T. violaceum), Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton floccosum.

If there are no signs of improvement after two weeks the diagnosis should be verified.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nIn vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Co-administration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug.\r\nContraindications\r\nTerbinafine tablet and cream are contra-indicated in individuals with hypersensitive to terbinafine.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Other adverse reactions that have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nTerbinafine tablet: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because treatment of onychomycosis can be postponed until after pregnancy is completed, it is recommended that terbinafine not be initiated during pregnancy. After oral administration, terbinafine is present in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Treatment with terbinafine is not recommended in nursing mothers.\r\n \nTerbinafine cream: Foetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse effects. There is no clinical experience with terbinafine in pregnant women; therefore, unless the potential benefits outweigh any potential risk, terbinafine should not be administered. Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not receive terbinafine treatment whilst breast-feeding.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWarnings-\r\nTelfin tablets: Rare cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets for the treatment of onychomycosis in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions and an uncertain causal association with terbinafine. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if there is biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury. There have been isolated reports of serious skin reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine should be discontinued.\r\nTelfin cream: Telfin cream is for external use only. Contact with the eyes should be avoided.\r\nPrecautions: Telfin are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Telfin, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Pretreatment serum transaminase (ALT and AST) teste are advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nPediatric use: The safety and efficacy of terbinafine have not been established in pediatric patients.\r\n \nUse in the elderly: There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients require different dosages or experience side-effects different to those of younger patients.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nClinical experience regarding overdose with terbinafine tablets is limited. Doses up to 5 gm (20 times the therapeutic daily dose) have been taken without inducing serious adverse reactions. The symptoms of overdose included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, frequent urination, and headache.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Antifungal preparations, Topical Antifungal preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool and dry place, below 30°C, protect from light.",

Treatment beyond two consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 gm/week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis.\rPharmacology\rLike other topical corticosteroids, halobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .\rDosage & Administration\rApply a thin layer of Halobetasol Cream or Ointment to the affected skin once or twice daily, as directed by the physician, and rub in gently and completely. Halobetasol 0.05% is a super-high potency corticosteroid; therefore, treatment should be limited to two weeks, and amounts greater than 50 gm/week should not be used.

The bioactivity of EPO is due primarily to its GLA contents. By supplying GLA, it bypasses the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of LA.

Clopirox Cream is also highly effective against some gram negative & some gram-positive bacteria. Owing to its anti-inflammatory effects, Clopirox alone is sufficient to treat mild to moderate inflammatory fungal infections\rPharmacology\rCiclopirox Olamine is a synthetic broad spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. Ciclopirox Olamine exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida albicans. The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium.In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Theanti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstratedin human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.\rDosage & Administration\rCiclopirox Cream should be gently massaged onto the affected and surrounding skin areas twice daily for four weeks.

        "description": "Indications\rBetameson cream and ointment is\rindicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of resistant or severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. These include-\rAtopic eczema\rNummular eczema\rContact dermatitis\rNeurodermatitis\rAnogenital and senile pruritus\rLichen planus\rPsoriasis\rPharmacology\rBetamethasone Dipropionate is a topical corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. Betamethasone Dipropionate induces peptides called lipocortins. Lipocortins antagonize phospholipase A2, an enzyme that causes the breakdown of leukocyte lysosomal membranes to release arachidonic acid. This action decreases the subsequent formation and release of endogenous inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, kinins, histamine.\r Pharmacokinetics: Betamethasone Dipropionate can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver.lt excreted by the kidneys.\rDosage & Administration\rApply a thin film once or twice daily to cover completely the affected area. Patients with chronic psoriasis who have achieved at least a marked improvement in their psoriatic lesion (i.e., approximately 80% improvement) with Betamethasone Dipropionate may be maintained in remission with a pulse dosing regimen consisting of three consecutive applications of up to 3.5 g each of Betamethasone Dipropionate cream and ointment, twelve hours apart (e.g., morning, evening, following morning) to the previously affected areas once each week. For this purpose, Betamethasone Dipropionate cream and ointment should be applied to the lesion sites previously affected and treated. Patients on this pulse dose regimen who relapse should be reverted back to the conventional dosing regimen.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere is no evidence of any kind of interaction.\rContraindications\rHypersensitivity to Betamethasone Dipropionate, other corticosteroids or any components in this preparation. Like other topical corticosteroids, Betamethasone Dipropionate is contraindicated in viral infections of the skin, such as vaccinia, varicella and Herpes simplex, also tuberculosis, acne rosacea, fungal skin infections (moniliasis), perioral dermatitis and ulcerative conditions.\rSide Effects\rThe most frequent side effects reported with Betameson are mild to moderate transient burning/stinging, dry skin, pruritus, irritation and folliculitis. Rarely reported adverse effects include tingling, prickly skin/tightening or cracking of skin, warm feeling,laminar scaling and perilesional scaling,follicular rash, skin atrophy, erythema, urticaria, vesiculation, telangiectasia, acneiform papules and hyperaesthesia.\r Adverse reactions reported with the use of the Betameson ointment pulse dose regimen were mild intermittent hypertension and paraesthesia. Other local adverse reactions that have been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids include: itching, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, miliaria and exacerbation of untreated infections\rPrecautions & Warnings\rBetameson should not be used in or near the eyes, as there is a potential risk of developing glaucoma and cataract. If irritation or sensitisation develops with the use of Betameson, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of an infection, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be administered. If a favourable response does not occur promptly, Betameson should be discontinued until the infection has been controlled adequately.\r Corticosteroids are known to be absorbed percutaneously, therefore in patients under prolonged and extensive topical treatment, the possibility of systemic effects should be kept in mind. Betameson is not intended for use under occlusive dressings since this will also increase systemic absorption of the corticosteroid. In infants the napkin may act as an occlusive dressing and increase absorption. Suitable precautions should be taken when using topical corticosteroids in patients with stasis dermatitis and other skin diseases with impaired circulation. Prolonged use of topical corticosteroid preparations may produce striae or atrophy of the skin or subcutaneous tissue. If this occurs, treatment should be discontinued.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdose with the ointment is unlikely and would not be expected to lead to a life-threatening situation. The ointment should not be used for longer than the prescribed time period.\rTherapeutic Class\rCorticosteroid\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Cutaneous. Creams are especially appropriate for moist or weeping surfaces. Ointments are especially appropriate for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCo-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.\rContraindications\rRosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis. Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Nyclobate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.\r Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.\r Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNeomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\rContraindications\rThis medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result.

However, if used in accordance with the recommendations systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is\r\nexpected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use\r\nof Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism\r\nmay appear and in this situation topical steroids should be discontinued gradually. Also, consideration should be given to\r\nsignificant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate. If this is suspected, use of the product should be stopped and the\r\npatient\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s general status, hearing acuity, renal and neuromuscular functions should be monitored. Haemodialysis may reduce\r\nthe serum level of Neomycin Sulphate.\r\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nNyclobate NN Cream: Each tube contains 10 gm or 20 gm cream.",

        "description": "PRESENTATION\r Each softgel capsule contains 500 mg Evening Primrose oil.\r  DESCRIPTION\r Evening Primrose oil is extracted from seeds of the Evening Primrose plant. Evening Primrose seeds have very high levels of the\ressential fatty acid \"Gamma-Linolenic Acid\" (GLA), also known as \"omega-6\". The oil contains up to 15% gamma-linolenic acid and\r70% linolenic acid, which our body turns into gamma-linolenic acid. The medicinal action of Evening Primrose oil revolves around\rthe omega-6-fatty acid portion, linolenic and gamma-linolenic acid, and its relationship with prostaglandin synthesis. In optimum\rconditions, linolenic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. The gamma-linolenic acid\rproduced is further converted todihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, which in turn leads to arachidonic acid. The dihomo-gamma-linolenic\racid gives rise of the Prostaglandin-1 (PGE1) series. PGE1 is anti-inflammatory in nature, promotes T-cell function and decreases\rcholesterol production\r  INDICATIONS\r Evening Primrose oil is used to treat breast pain associated with the menstrual cycle, menopausal symptoms, premenstrual syndrome,\rdermatitis, eczema and psoriasis etc. It is highly recommended for lactating mother as it improves lactation.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r 1-2 capsules 2/3 times a day\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Evening Primrose oil is usually safe for most people.

This cream is composed of Econazole Nitrate, a powerful antifungal and Triamcinolone Acetonide to enforce its antimicrobial effect and the effect of subduing comprehensive inflammations, therefore, it provides remarkable effects on mixed infections of gram-positive and fungus, eczema and recurrent inflammations and shows special effects on bacterial inflammations of skin folds. The range of action of econazole covers all dermatomycoses caused by the following pathogens:- Dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum, Cladosporium, Yeasts, such as Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Moulds, Fungi, such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Aspergillus flavus, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomycosis dermatitidis, and others. As well as Malassezia furfur and Nocardia minutissima.\r Moreover, it has antibacterial effect on gram-positive cocci and bacilli, including Streptococcus pyogens and Staphylococcus aureus. It is also effective against Trichomonus vaginalis, versicolor and balanitis. On the other hand Triamcinolone Acetonide is a synthetic steroid which inhibits not only the early phenomena of the inflammatory process but also the later manifestations.\r Pharmacological Properties: Econazole Nitrate is only slightly (<0.1%) absorbed from the skin. So no active drug has been detected in the serum. But Triamcinolone Acetonide is well absorbed from sites of local application.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: This cream should be applied sparingly to the skin lesion no more than 2 times daily, preferably once in the morning and once in the evening. This cream should not be applied with an occlusive dressing, or to large areas of skin on the body. The duration of treatment with this cream should continue until the inflammatory symptoms subside but not longer than 2 weeks; after 2 weeks of therapy with this cream, continue therapy as needed with a preparation containing econazole or econazole nitrate alone.\r Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight. Caution should be exercised.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rEconazole: compound metabolized by CYP3A4/2C9 oral anticoagulants (warfarin & acenocoumarol).\r Triamcinolone: lowering of plasma salicylates levels. Increased risk of Gl bleeding and ulceration with NSAIDs. Antagonised blood glucose-lowering effects of the antidiabetics. Increased risk of Hyperkalemia with amphotericin B, beta-blockers, potassium-depleting diuretics, theophylline. Increased clearance of the triamcinolone with ciclosporin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, barbiturate, rifampicin.\rContraindications\rThis Cream is contraindicated-\rIn individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\rLike any other dermatological preparation containing corticosteroids, this Cream is contraindicated in specific skin conditions such as tuberculous, varicella, herpes simplex or other viral infections of the skin, or fresh vaccination sites.\rDecubitus ulcers: Viral, bacterial or fungal skin infections (e.g. tuberculosis of the skin, syphilis of the skin, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chickenpox).\rRosacea and rosacea-like dermatitis.\rSide Effects\rRarely, transient local mild irritation, itching & redness may occur immediately after application. Econazole has the minimal allergenic effect and is well tolerated, even by delicate skin. Adrenal suppression on long term continuous topical steroid therapy may occur, particularly in infants or children, or when occlusive dressings are applied. It should be noted that an infant's napkin may act as an occlusive dressing.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Not the Econazole but the Triamcinolone Acetonide crosses the placenta and topical administration of corticosteroids during pregnancy can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to human beings has not been established. However, topical steroids in large amounts or for prolonged periods\rshould not be used in pregnancy.\r Lactation: Negligible amount of econazole and to some extent Triamcinolone may be excreted in small amounts in breast milk. So this cream should not be prescribed to the lactating mother or if prescribed lactation should be withheld during treatment.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rFor external use only. This Cream is not for ophthalmic or oral use.\rIf a reaction suggesting hypersensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued.\rCorticosteroids applied to the skin can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects, including adrenal suppression. Systemic absorption may be increased by various factors such as application over a large skin surface area, application to damaged skin, application under occlusive skin dressings and prolonged duration of therapy.\rTopical corticosteroids are associated with skin thinning and atrophy, striae, telangiectasis and purpura.\rTopical corticosteroids may lead to increased risk of dermatological superinfection or opportunistic infection.\rChildren: Increased caution is required when treating children. Compared to adults, the nature of a child's skin and the larger skin surface area relative to body weight may lead to an increased absorption of the corticosteroid via the child's skin. This cream should be used in children only for short periods of time (less than 2 weeks) and on small areas (less than 10% of body surface area).\r Visual disturbance may be associated with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).\rOverdose Effects\rThis Cream is for cutaneous application only. Corticosteroids applied to the skin, including triamcinolone, can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects. In the event of accidental ingestion, treat symptomatically. If this cream is accidentally applied to the eyes, wash with clean water or saline and seek medical attention if symptoms persist.\rTherapeutic Class\rTriamcinolone & Combined preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool (below 30°C) and dry place, away from light.

        "description": "Indications\rCandirox Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of the following dermal infections: Tinea pedis, Tinea cruris and Tinea corporis due to Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis, candidiasis (moniliasis) due to Candida albicans, and Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur. Candirox Cream is also highly effective against some gram negative & some gram-positive bacteria. Owing to its anti-inflammatory effects, Candirox alone is sufficient to treat mild to moderate inflammatory fungal infections\rPharmacology\rCiclopirox Olamine is a synthetic broad spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. Ciclopirox Olamine exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida albicans. The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium.In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Theanti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstratedin human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.\rDosage & Administration\rCiclopirox Cream should be gently massaged onto the affected and surrounding skin areas twice daily for four weeks. Clinical improvement with relief of pruritus and other symptoms usually occurs within the first week of treatment. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after four weeks of treatment with Ciclopirox cream, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

Candirox Cream is also highly effective against some gram negative & some gram-positive bacteria. Owing to its anti-inflammatory effects, Candirox alone is sufficient to treat mild to moderate inflammatory fungal infections\r\nPharmacology\r\nCiclopirox Olamine is a synthetic broad spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. Ciclopirox Olamine exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and Candida albicans. The mode of action of Ciclopirox Olamine was studied mainly in Candida albicans. It is presumed that Ciclopirox Olamine mediated growth inhibition or death of fungal cells is primarily caused by in vitro cellular depletion of some essential substrates and/or ions and that such effects are brought about through blockage of their uptake from the medium.In addition to its broad spectrum of antifungal action, Ciclopirox also exerts antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Theanti-inflammatory effects of Ciclopirox have been demonstratedin human polymorphonuclear cells, where Ciclopirox has inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene. Ciclopirox can also exhibit its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the formation of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nCiclopirox Cream should be gently massaged onto the affected and surrounding skin areas twice daily for four weeks. Clinical improvement with relief of pruritus and other symptoms usually occurs within the first week of treatment. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after four weeks of treatment with Ciclopirox cream, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with Tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.\r\n \nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 years have not been established.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nContraindications\r\nCiclopirox Olamine cream is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCandirox cream is well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse reactions reported in clinical trials.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy category B.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Topiclo is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rFacid Ointment is indicated for treatment of skin infections caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci, Corynebacterium minutissimum and other Fusidate sensitive organisms. The most important indications being: impetigo, boils, abscess, varicose ulcers, skin grafts, hidradenitis, infected wounds, sycosis barbae, paronychia, folliculitis, carbuncles and erythrasma.\rPharmacology\rSodium Fusidate, an antibiotic derived from Fusidium coccineum, exerts powerful activity against a number of gram-positive organisms. Staphylococci, including the strains resistant to penicillin or other antibiotics, are particularly susceptible to Sodium Fusidate. The therapeutic efficacy of topically applied Sodium Fusidate is due partly to the pronounced antibacterial activity of Sodium Fusidate against the organisms responsible for skin infection and partly to the unique ability of this antibiotic to penetrate intact skin.\r Fusidic Acid is an anti-microbial agent that acts as an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the microorganism. It interferes with the translocation step by stabilizing the ribosome-guanosine dephosphate elongation factor G-complex. This prevents binding of aminoacyl t-RNA to the ribosome and thereafter stops transfer of additional amino acids to the growing polypeptide.\rDosage & Administration\rSodium Fusidate Ointment or cream is applied to the affected areas 2 to 3 times daily, generally for a period of 7 days. It can be used with or without a covering dressing. Caution should be observed when applying Sodium Fusidate Ointment near the eye region as this preparation may cause irritation if it gets into the eye.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rRoute of administration: Cutaneous.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Exovate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.\r Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.\r Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNeomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\rContraindications\rThis medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur. No overdose-related problem yet reported. However, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation, topical steroids should be discontinued gradually.\rTherapeutic Class\rClobetasol / Clobetasone & Combined Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 25°C temperature.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils.

Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\r\nDosage\r\nCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r\n \nSpray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in.

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.\rDosage & Administration\rAdults: Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. In very resistant lesion, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the anti-inflammatory effect of this preparation can be enhanced (if necessary) by occluding the treatment area with polythene. Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed.\r Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.\r Children: This preparation is suitable for use in children (2 years and over) at the same dose as adults. A possibility of increased absorption exists in very young children, thus this cream/ointment is not recommended for use in neonates and infants (younger than 2 years).\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNeomycin Sulphate can intensify and prolong the respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blocking agents following significant systemic absorption. However, if used in accordance with the recommendations, systemic exposure to Neomycin Sulphate is expected to be minimal and drug interactions are unlikely to be significant. No hazardous interactions have been reported with use of Clobetasol Propionate or Nystatin.\rContraindications\rThis medication is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infection (eg-Herpes simplex, chicken pox) and hypersensitivity to the preparation.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids, prolonged use of large amount or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercortisolism. The effect is more likely to occur in infants and children and if occlusive dressings are used. Prolonged and intensive treatment with highly active corticosteroid preparations may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae, and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used, or when skin folds are involved. There are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is little information to demonstrate the possible effect of topically applied Neomycin in pregnancy and lactation. However, Neomycin present in the maternal blood can cross the placenta and may give rise to a theoretical risk of foetal toxicity, thus the use of the preparation is not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. The safety of Clobetasol Propionate has not been established in lactating mothers.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma might result. If this medication does enter the eye, the affected eye should be thoroughly washed with copious amount of water.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur. No overdose-related problem yet reported. However, in the case of chronic overdosage or misuse, the features of hypercortisolism may appear and in this situation, topical steroids should be discontinued gradually.\rTherapeutic Class\rClobetasol / Clobetasone & Combined Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore below 25°C temperature.

In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r\n \nClobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r\n \nSpray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r\n \nShampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r\n \nScalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Scalp Solution for brief periods only.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nRoute of administration: Cutaneous. Creams are especially appropriate for moist or weeping surfaces. Ointments are especially appropriate for dry, lichenified or scaly lesions.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nCo-administered drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4 (eg ritonavir, itraconazole) have been shown to inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids leading to increased systemic exposure.\r\nContraindications\r\nRosacea, acne vulgaris and perioral dermatitis. Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\r\nHypersensitivity to the preparation.\r\nThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\r\nDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\r\nSide Effects\r\nAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\r\nProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\r\nIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\r\nThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Clovate is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r\n \nIt is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r\n \nThe face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r\n \nIf applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r\n \nTopical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r\n \nAppropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nOther Topical corticosteroids\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture. Do not freeze. Keep out of the reach of children.",

Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. Corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.\rDosage & Administration\rDesonide gel is for external use only. Gel should be applied as a thin layer to the affected areas two times daily and rubbed in gently. Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued and Desonide gel should not be used with occlusive dressings.\r Pediatric use: The safety and effectiveness of Desonide gel in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age have not been evaluated, and therefore its use in this age group is not recommended.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rDesonide gel is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.\rSide Effects\rThe most common local side effects are burning, rash and pruritus at the application site.

This spray is also indicated in the treatment of pityriasis (tinea) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur.\rPharmacology\rTerbinafine, an Allylamine antifungal, inhibits biosynthesis of Ergosterol (an essential component of fungai cell membrane) via inhibition of Squalene Epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to the increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of Squalene but not due to Ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species test in vitro, Terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown. Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Tricophyton Mentagrophyte, Trichophyton Rubrum.\rDosage & Administration\rTerbinafine tablet:\rFor the treatment of fingernail onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg (one tablet), once daily for 6 weeks.\rFor the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: Terbinafine 250 mg (one tablet), once daily for 12 weeks.\rThe optimal clinical effect is seen some months after mycological cure and cessation of treatment.

Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Co-administration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug.\rContraindications\rTerbinafine tablet and cream are contra-indicated in individuals with hypersensitive to terbinafine.\rSide Effects\rThe adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis). Other adverse reactions that have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rTerbinafine tablet: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because treatment of onychomycosis can be postponed until after pregnancy is completed, it is recommended that terbinafine not be initiated during pregnancy. After oral administration, terbinafine is present in the breast milk of nursing mothers. Treatment with terbinafine is not recommended in nursing mothers.\r Terbinafine cream: Foetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse effects. There is no clinical experience with terbinafine in pregnant women; therefore, unless the potential benefits outweigh any potential risk, terbinafine should not be administered. Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not receive terbinafine treatment whilst breast-feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rWarnings-\rDermafin tablets: Rare cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets for the treatment of onychomycosis in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions and an uncertain causal association with terbinafine. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if there is biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury. There have been isolated reports of serious skin reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine should be discontinued.\rDermafin cream: Dermafin cream is for external use only. Contact with the eyes should be avoided.\rPrecautions: Dermafin are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Dermafin, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Pretreatment serum transaminase (ALT and AST) teste are advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets.\rUse in Special Populations\rPediatric use: The safety and efficacy of terbinafine have not been established in pediatric patients.\r Use in the elderly: There is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients require different dosages or experience side-effects different to those of younger patients.\rOverdose Effects\rClinical experience regarding overdose with terbinafine tablets is limited. Doses up to 5 gm (20 times the therapeutic daily dose) have been taken without inducing serious adverse reactions. The symptoms of overdose included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, frequent urination, and headache.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Antifungal preparations, Topical Antifungal preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, below 30°C, protect from light.\nIndications\r\nDermafin tablet: This tablet is indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).\r\n \nDermafin granules: This is indicated in Tinea Capitis.\r\n \nDermafin cream: Fungal infection of the skin caused by Trichophyton (e.g. T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. verrucosum, T. violaceum), Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton floccosum.

For moist or dry eczema or dermatitis including atopic eczema, primary irritant or contact allergic eczema or seborrheic eczema including that associated with acne. Also for interiginous eczema including inflammatory interigo, perianal and genital dermatitis. Organisms which are susceptible to miconazole are dermatophytes and pathogenic yeasts (e.g. Candida spp.): also many Gram-positive bacteria including many strains of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.\rPharmacology\rMiconazole is a substituted imidazole, is one of the family of azoles useful in treating the superficial candidiasis and of the skin infections dermatophytosis and pityriasis versicolor, acanthameaba, seborrhoic dermatitis. Also active against Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudalescheria boydii and some gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococci and Streptococci.\r Hydrocortisone is a naturally occurring glucocorticoid that's now prepared synthetically. Its important function is in the skin injury such as inflammation. Also it has antipruritic, antimycotic and vasoconstrictive activity.\r Miconazole is imidazole antifungal agents that interfere with ergosterol synthesis and therefore alters the permeability of the cell membrane of sensitive fungi. Thus causes the killing of fungi, when applied to the skin, Hydrocortisone is absorbed into the skin cells. It prevents the release of certain chemicals, which is responsible for inflammation. Thus hydrocortisone reduces inflammation.\rDosage & Administration\rApply to the affected area as a thin film two or four times daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Rub it well with your finger until this cream fully vanished on the skin. Treatment should be continued at least one week after the disappearance of all signs and symptoms. The same dosage applies to both adults and children.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAmphotericin antagonizes the activity of Miconazole.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in individuals who are hypersensitive to it or any of its components. Should not be used in pregnant mother and lactating mother without physician's advice.\rSide Effects\rRarely local sensitivity may occur. Long term use may decrease in the production of natural hormones by the adrenal gland.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAdministration of corticosteroids to pregnant animal at high doses can cause abnormalities of fetal development. Topical steroids should not be extensively used in pregnancy.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rTo be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician. Keep out of reach of children.

Organisms which are susceptible to miconazole are dermatophytes and pathogenic yeasts (e.g. Candida spp.): also many Gram-positive bacteria including many strains of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.\r\nPharmacology\r\nMiconazole is a substituted imidazole, is one of the family of azoles useful in treating the superficial candidiasis and of the skin infections dermatophytosis and pityriasis versicolor, acanthameaba, seborrhoic dermatitis. Also active against Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudalescheria boydii and some gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococci and Streptococci.\r\n \nHydrocortisone is a naturally occurring glucocorticoid that's now prepared synthetically. Its important function is in the skin injury such as inflammation. Also it has antipruritic, antimycotic and vasoconstrictive activity.\r\n \nMiconazole is imidazole antifungal agents that interfere with ergosterol synthesis and therefore alters the permeability of the cell membrane of sensitive fungi. Thus causes the killing of fungi, when applied to the skin, Hydrocortisone is absorbed into the skin cells. It prevents the release of certain chemicals, which is responsible for inflammation. Thus hydrocortisone reduces inflammation.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nApply to the affected area as a thin film two or four times daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Rub it well with your finger until this cream fully vanished on the skin. Treatment should be continued at least one week after the disappearance of all signs and symptoms. The same dosage applies to both adults and children.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nAmphotericin antagonizes the activity of Miconazole.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in individuals who are hypersensitive to it or any of its components. Should not be used in pregnant mother and lactating mother without physician's advice.\r\nSide Effects\r\nRarely local sensitivity may occur. Long term use may decrease in the production of natural hormones by the adrenal gland.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAdministration of corticosteroids to pregnant animal at high doses can cause abnormalities of fetal development. Topical steroids should not be extensively used in pregnancy.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nTo be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician. Keep out of reach of children. Take care or consult with a physician in case of use in children and elderly people for long-term use.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nHydrocortisone & Combined preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

It is an immunosuppressant which inhibits the activation of T-cells and prevents the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. It is used for the short term or intermittent long term treatment for mild to moderate atopic eczema.\r The mechanism of action of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T-cells. In addition, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/IgE.\rDosage & Administration\rApply a thin layer of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% to the affected skin twice daily. The patient should stop using Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% when signs and symptoms (e.g., itch, rash and redness) resolve and should be instructed on what actions to take if symptoms recur.\r If signs and symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks, patients should be re-examined by their health care provider to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.\r Continuous long-term use of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% should be avoided, and application should be limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis\r The safety of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% under occlusion, which may promote systemic exposure, has not been evaluated.

Topical steroids are primarily effective because of their anti-inflammatory, antipruritic & vasoconstrictive actions.\rDosage & Administration\rA small amount of Triamcinolone is gently rub to the affected area 1-2 times daily. Some cases of eczematised psoriasis may be treated more effectively by the application of Triamcinolone under an occlusive dressing.\r Occlusive dressing technique: Gently rub a small amount of Triamcinolone on the lesion until it disappears. Then reapply, leaving a thin coating and cover with a pliable non porous film. For convenience apply Triamcinolone intermittently (12 hour occlusion during the night) followed by reapplication without occlusion, during the day.\r Pediatric use: Triamcinolone should not be used in children under 8 years. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children. As children are more likely to get side effects, they should not normally be treated for longer than 5 days.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rTriamcinolone Acetonide is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation. It is also contraindicated in tuberculosis of the skin, fungus infections and viral diseases of the skin (Herpes simplex, chickenpox and vaccinia), perioral dermatitis, rosacea and ulcerative conditions.\rSide Effects\rThe following local side effects have been reported with topical corticosteroids, either with or without occlusive dressings: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae and miliaria.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

It is involved in vital physiological function like fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis. It acts as a cofactor in the enzymatic carboxylation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Biotin influences the growth and differentiation of epidermal cells and is therefore important for the formation and renewal of the skin, hair and nails. It functions as a coenzyme for mitochondrial carboxylases in hair roots and improves the keratin structure.

Absorbed permethrin is rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis, most likely in the liver and the products are excreted primarily in the urine.\r\nDosage\r\nRecommended duration of Treatment:\r\nAdults and children over 12 years: a full tube\r\nChildren aged 6-12 years: up to 1⁄2 of a tube\r\nChildren aged 1-5 years: up to  ¼ of a tube\r\nChildren aged 2 months to 1 year: up to ⅛ of a tube\r\nChildren Less then 2 month: dose is not established\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nAdministration\r\nBefore application of Permethrin cream the skin should be clean, cool and dry. Do not have a hot shower or bath before applying.\r\n \nFor adults and children over 2 years: Apply the cream to the whole body from the neck down, rubbing lightly into the skin until the cream disappears. It is important to include all skin surfaces, such as between the fingers and toes, under the nails and on the soles of the feet.\r\n \nFor babies under 2 years: Apply to the face, neck, ears and scalp as well, only avoiding the area immediately around the eyes and mouth.\r\n \nLeave cream on for at least 8 hours, before washing off. Reapply to any area that may be washed during the 8h treatment time (such as after washing the hands). If necessary, permethrin cream should be used again after 7 days as per the advice of the doctor.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nThe treatment of eczemodous like reactions with corticosteroids should be withheld prior to treatment with Elimate, as there is a risk of exacerbating the scabies infestation by reducing the immune response to the mite.\r\nContraindications\r\nPermethrin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of pyrethroids or permethrin. Nursing staff who routinely apply permethrin may wear globes to avoid any possible irritation to the hands.\r\nSide Effects\r\nIn Scabies patients, skin discomfort, usually described as burning, stinging or tingling occurs in a few individuals soon after the cream is applied. Others transient signs and symptoms of irritation including enythema, edema, eczema, rash and puritis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nIn the absence of specific studies in pregnant women, its use in pregnancy should only follow medical advice. It is not known whether permethrin is excreted in human milk so it should not be used in nursing mothers.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nScabies infestation is often accompanied by pruritus, edema & erythema. Treatment with Elimate may temporarily exacerbate these conditions. Patients should be advised to avoid contact with eyes during application & to flash with water immediately if the cream gets in the eyes.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nParasiticidal preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool, dry place, away from light & keep out of the reach of children...\r\n",

The mechanism of action involves inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a major sterol in the fungal cell membrane. This leads to instability of the cell membrane and eventual death of the fungus. Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. But the exact mechanism of action of corticosteroids is not clearly known.\rDosage & Administration\rSufficient topical preparation should be applied onto the affected and surrounding skin areas twice a day, in the morning and evening, for 2 weeks in tinea cruris and tinea corporis and for 4 weeks in tinea pedis. The use of this cream for longer than four weeks is not recommended.\r The safety and effectiveness of the preparation have not been established in children below the age of 12 years.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo information is available of drug interaction.\rContraindications\rThis topical preparation is contraindicated to those patients who are sensitive to any of its components or to other corticosteroids or to imidazoles. If irritation or sensitization develops with the use of the cream, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. The cream is contraindicated in facial rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatits, perianal and genital pruritus, napkin eruptions and bacterial or viral infections. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroides can produce reversible hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug or to reduce the frequency of application. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their large skin surface to body mass ratios.\rSide Effects\rAdverse reactions reported for the preparation in clinical trials were paresthesia in 1.9% of patients, rash, edema and secondary infection, each in less than 1% of patients. Other adverse reactions reported with the preparation were burning and dry skin in 1.6% of patients and stinging in less than 1% of patients\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere is inadequate evidence of safety in pregnancy.

It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It shows anti-inflammatory activity via multiple mechanisms to inhibit late phase allergic reactions. It decreases the density of mast cells, chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils. It also reduces cytokine production and inhibits the metabolism of arachidonic acid.\rDosage\rCream, Ointment: Adults, elderly and children over 1 year: Apply a thin layer of Clobetasol Propionate Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Repeated short courses of Clobetasol Propionate may be used to control exacerbations. In more resistant lesions, especially where there is hyperkeratosis, the effect of Clobetasol can be enhanced, if necessary, by occluding the treatment area with polythene film. Overnight occlusion only is usually adequate to bring about a satisfactory response.\r Clobetasol Propionate is super-high potency topical corticosteroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks. The maximum weekly dose should not be exceeded 50 gm/week. In case of children, courses should be limited if possible to five days and reviewed weekly.\r Spray: Apply required quantity of spray of once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals. It is advisable to use Clobetasol Propionate scalp solution for brief periods only.\r Shampoo: It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only. It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing. Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week. Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.\r Scalp Solution: Apply required quantity of spray of Clobetasol Scalp Solution once or twice daily to the affected areas of the scalp and gently rub in. The total dose applied should not exceed 50 ml weekly. If necessary, Clobetasol Scalp Solution may be massaged into the scalp using the tips of the fingers. Therapy should be discontinued if no response is noted after one week or as soon as the lesion heals.

Primary cutaneous viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex, chickenpox).\rHypersensitivity to the preparation.\rThe use of Clobetasol Propionate skin preparations is not indicated in the treatment of primarily infected skin lesions caused by infection with fungi (e.g. candidiasis, tinea), or bacteria (e.g.impetigo): perianal and genital pruritus.\rDermatoses in children under one year of age, including dermatitis and napkin eruptions.\rSide Effects\rAs with other topical corticosteroids prolonged use of large amounts, or treatment of extensive areas can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce the features of hypercorticism.\rProlonged and intensive treatment with a highly active corticosteroid preparation may cause local atrophic changes in the skin such as thinning, striae and dilatation of the superficial blood vessels, particularly when occlusive dressings are used or when skin folds are involved.\rIn rare instances, treatment of psoriasis with corticosteroids (or its withdrawal) is thought to have provoked the pustular form of the disease.\rThere are reports of pigmentation changes and hypertrichosis with topical steroids. Dermex is usually well tolerated, but if signs of hypersensitivity appear, application should be stopped immediately. Exacerbation of symptoms may occur.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are limited data from the use of Clobetasol Propionate cream in pregnant women. Topical administration of corticosteroids to pregnant animals can cause abnormalities of foetal development. The relevance of this finding to humans has not been established. However, the administration of Clobetasol Propionate Cream during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risks of treatment.\r It is unknown whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clobetasol Propionate Cream is administered to a nursing woman.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rLong-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood or on the face, courses should be limited if possible to five days and occlusion should not be used.\r The face, more than other areas of the body, may exhibit atrophic changes after prolonged treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema.\r If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result.\r Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.\r Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents. Bacterial infection is encouraged by the warm, moist conditions induced by occlusive dressings, and so the skin should be cleansed before a fresh dressing is applied.\rUse in Special Populations\rIn infants and children under 12 years of age, long-term continuous topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided where possible, as adrenal suppression can occur. Children are more susceptible to the use of topical corticosteroids which develops atrophic changes.\rOverdose Effects\rAcute overdosage is very unlikely to occur, however, in the case of chronic over-dosage or misuse the features of hypercortisolism may occur and in this situation topical steroid should be discontinued.\rTherapeutic Class\rOther Topical corticosteroids\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, protected from light and moisture.

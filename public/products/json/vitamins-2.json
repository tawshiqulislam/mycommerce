        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated on prophylaxis of iron deficiency especially when inadequate diet calls for supplementary zinc and iron during pregnancy and anemia.\rDescription\rIt is an oral iron, folic acid and zinc preparation indicated for the treatment of iron, folic acid and zinc deficiency.\rPharmacology\rFerrous Ascorbate, Folic Acid & Zinc is a combination of three nutritional supplements. Ferrous Ascorbate is a combination of iron and vitamin C. Iron replenishes the iron stores in your body and corrects iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is added to enhance the absorption of iron in the body. Folic Acid is a form of vitamin B. It plays a vital role in the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. It is also essential in pregnancy due to its role in the development of the unborn baby's brain and spinal cord. Zinc is a micromineral that provides nutrition.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult & Elderly: One tablet a day before or after meal (food independent absorption) or as directed by the physician. In more severe cases, two tablets a day may be required as prescribed by the physician.\r Pediatric patients: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIron chelates with tetracycline. Since oral iron products interfere with absorption of oral tetracycline antibiotics, Hemofix FZ should not be taken within two hours of each other. Occasional gastrointestinal discomfort may be minimized by taking with meals. Absorption of iron may be impaired by concurrent administrations of penicillamine and antacid. In patients with renal failure, a risk of zinc accumulation may exist.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients with haemolytic anaemia and in conditions with increased hypersensitivity to any of its components and increased body iron content.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of iron, folic acid and zinc supplementation are mild and transient. These include epigastric pain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, heart burn, etc. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIf pregnant, or planning to become pregnant or are currently breast-feeding please contact your physician, before taking or continuing the drug. Administration in first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided unless definite evidence of iron deficiency is observed. Prophylaxis of iron deficiency is justified during the remainder of pregnancy specifically when zinc supplementation is required.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken in patients who may develop iron overload, such as those with haemochromatosis, haemolytic anemia or red cell aplasia. Failure to respond to treatment may indicate other causes of anemia and should be further investigated.\rOverdose Effects\rThe clinical course of acute iron overdosage can be variable. Initial symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tarry stools, melena, hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, dehydration, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, shock and coma.\rTherapeutic Class\rIron, Vitamin & Mineral Combined preparation\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rVitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\rDosage & Administration\rFor capsule: Adults:\rTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks.

Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient, which means it cannot be produced by the body and therefore must be obtained from diet or supplements. Ascorbic Acid has many important functions. It is required for tissue growth & repair, Adrenal gland function, enhanced immunity & healthy gums. As an antioxidant, it gives protection against harmful pollution, infection & reduces cellular damage. As a coenzyme, it is a necessary factor for wound healing, drug metabolism & metabolism of cholesterol & folic acid. As an essential nutrient, vitamin C supports healthy hair & skin, strengthens the immune system and maintain overall good health.\rDosage & Administration\rOral tablet administration:\rFor the prevention of scurvy: 1 tablet daily\rFor the treatment of scurvy: 1-2 tablets daily; but dose may be increased depending on the severity of the condition.\rFor the reduction of risk of stroke in the elderly: 1-2 tablets daily.\rIn other cases: 1 tablet daily or as directed by the physician.\rMaximum safe dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses.\rOral sachet administration: 1 sachet daily or as directed by registered physician. Maximum Dose: 2000 mg/day (4 sachets/day).\r Parenteral administration:\rVitamin C is usually administered orally. When oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected, the drug may be administered IM, IV, or subcutaneously. When given parenterally, utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after IM administration and that is the preferred parenteral route.\rFor intravenous injection, dilution into a large volume parenteral such as Normal Saline, Water for Injection, or Glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection.\rThe average protective dose of vitamin C for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily. In the presence of scurvy, doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended. However, as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity.\rTo enhance wound healing, doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate, although considerably larger amounts have been recommended. In the treatment of burns, doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury. For severe burns, daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended. In other conditions in which the need for vitamin C is increased, three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate.\rParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Ascorbic acid is incompatible in solution with aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin sodium, conjugated oestrogen, sodium bicarbonate, sulphafurazole diethanolamine, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, chlorthiazide sodium and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.\r Useful interactions: Ascorbic acid increases the apparent half-life of paracetamol and enhances iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.\rSide Effects\rNutrivit-C has little toxicity and only mega-doses of Nutrivit-C may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug is safe in normal doses in pregnant women, but a daily intake of 5 gm or more is reported to have caused abortion.

In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur.\r B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination. Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.\rDosage & Administration\rSyrup-\rAdults: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 2 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\rChildren: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 1 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\rInfants: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) 1 to 2 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\rTablet-\rAdults & Children over 30 kg: 1 to 2 tablets 2 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rConcomitant intake of tetracyclines and zinc may decrease the Gl absorption and serum levels of tetracyclines.

        "description": "Indications\rAncor is indicated in-\rHypertension\rAngina\rModerate to severe heart failure\rAncor is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.\rBisoren - MedEx campaign banner\rBislol - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Hemifumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy.\r The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties.\r Absorption and bioavailability: Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg.\r Metabolism: Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role.\r Elimination: The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult: In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit.\r Children: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\r Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment: In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.\r Geriatrics: In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rOther β-blocking Agents: Ancor fumarate should not be combined with other β-blocking agents.\r Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs: Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be monitored closely because the added β-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.\r Centrally Active Antihypertensive Agents: β-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the β-blocker should be withdrawn several days before discontinuing clonidine. If replacing clonidine by β-blocker therapy, the introduction of β-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped (see also prescribing information for clonidine).\r Antiarrhythmic Agents: Ancor fumarate should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of A-V conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenyl alkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.\r Calcium Channel Blockers: Combined use of β-blockers and calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects can lead to prolongation of S-A and A-V conduction, particularly in patients with impaired ventricular function or conduction abnormalities. This may result in severe hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac failure.\rContraindications\rIn patients with cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure, second or third degree A-V block, right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension and sinus bradycardia.\rSide Effects\rMedicines and their possible side effects can affect individual people in different ways. The following are some of the side effects that are known to be associated with this medicine. Just because a side effect is stated here does not mean that all people using this medicine will experience that or any side effect. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Cold or numb extremities, e.g; hands and feet. Muscle weakness or cramps. Slower than normal heart breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is 375 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r Lactation: Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rImpaired renal or hepatic function use caution in adjusting the dose of Ancor in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti adrenergic agent (Beta blockers), Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a dry place away from light and heat.

        "description": "Indications\rAntioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows:\r β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.\rPharmacology\rBeta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity.\r Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption.\r vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.\rDosage & Administration\rThis tablet is administered orally. The adult dose of this combination of antioxidant vitamin tablet is 1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCholestyramine, Colestipol, Neomycin cause decreased absorption of β carotene. Circulating vitamin C levels have been shown to be reduced during prolonged administration of oral contraceptives containing Oestrogen, Tetracycline and Aspirin. The decrease in vitamin C level may be due to drug induced impaired absorption or increased utilization of the vitamin for drug metabolism. Vitamin E may enhance the anticoagulant activity of anticoagulant drugs. High doses of vitamin E can impair intestinal absorption of vitamins A and K.\rContraindications\rCarocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.\rSide Effects\rβ carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids.\r Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation.\r Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rβ carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rThere are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria.

Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient, which means it cannot be produced by the body and therefore must be obtained from diet or supplements. Ascorbic Acid has many important functions. It is required for tissue growth & repair, Adrenal gland function, enhanced immunity & healthy gums. As an antioxidant, it gives protection against harmful pollution, infection & reduces cellular damage. As a coenzyme, it is a necessary factor for wound healing, drug metabolism & metabolism of cholesterol & folic acid. As an essential nutrient, vitamin C supports healthy hair & skin, strengthens the immune system and maintain overall good health.\rDosage & Administration\rOral tablet administration:\rFor the prevention of scurvy: 1 tablet daily\rFor the treatment of scurvy: 1-2 tablets daily; but dose may be increased depending on the severity of the condition.\rFor the reduction of risk of stroke in the elderly: 1-2 tablets daily.\rIn other cases: 1 tablet daily or as directed by the physician.\rMaximum safe dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses.\rOral sachet administration: 1 sachet daily or as directed by registered physician. Maximum Dose: 2000 mg/day (4 sachets/day).\r Parenteral administration:\rVitamin C is usually administered orally. When oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected, the drug may be administered IM, IV, or subcutaneously. When given parenterally, utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after IM administration and that is the preferred parenteral route.\rFor intravenous injection, dilution into a large volume parenteral such as Normal Saline, Water for Injection, or Glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection.\rThe average protective dose of vitamin C for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily. In the presence of scurvy, doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended. However, as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity.\rTo enhance wound healing, doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate, although considerably larger amounts have been recommended. In the treatment of burns, doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury. For severe burns, daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended. In other conditions in which the need for vitamin C is increased, three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate.\rParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Ascorbic acid is incompatible in solution with aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin sodium, conjugated oestrogen, sodium bicarbonate, sulphafurazole diethanolamine, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, chlorthiazide sodium and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.\r Useful interactions: Ascorbic acid increases the apparent half-life of paracetamol and enhances iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.\rSide Effects\rVasco has little toxicity and only mega-doses of Vasco may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug is safe in normal doses in pregnant women, but a daily intake of 5 gm or more is reported to have caused abortion. The drug may be taken safely during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIngestion of megadose (more than 1000 mg daily) of Vasco during pregnancy has resulted in scurvy in neonates. Vasco in mega-doses has been contraindicated for patients with hyperoxaluria.

Additional symptoms of vitamin B deficiency are sleep disturbances, nausea, poor appetite, frequent infections, and skin lesions.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nSyrup-\r\nAdults: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 2 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\r\nChildren: 10 ml (2 teaspoonful) 1 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\r\nInfants: 5 ml (1 teaspoonful) 1 to 2 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\r\nTablet-\r\nAdults & Children over 30 kg: 1 to 2 tablets 2 to 3 times daily or as recommended by the physician.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nConcomitant intake of tetracyclines and zinc may decrease the Gl absorption and serum levels of tetracyclines. Similarly concomitant administration of zinc and fluroquinolones may decrease the Gl absorption and serum  levels of some fluroquinolones. Coadministration of Niacin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (eg. lovastatin) may result mayopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Pyridoxine reduces levodopa's effectiveness by increasing its peripheral metabolism. Co-administration of pyridoxine with phenytoin may decrease serum levels of phenytoin.\r\nContraindications\r\nVitamin B Complex & Zinc is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this product.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThis is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea & stomach upset may occur. Side effects have been reported with specific vitamins but generally at levels substantially higher than recommended doses.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThis is recommended in pregnancy and lactation.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIn acute renal failure, zinc accumulation may occur, so dosage adjustment is needed. This is not intended for the treatment of severe specific deficiencies.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIn case of overdosage, initially epigastric pain, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur. In that case, one should seek emergency medical attention. Initially, an emetic should be given and then gastric lavage and general supportive measures should be employed.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSpecific mineral & vitamin combined preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in a cool & dry place, protected from light.

The suspension work in two ways-\rNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\rForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\rThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\rGaviraft - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rFor oral suspension:\rAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\rElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\rChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed.

Iron Polymaltose Complex is a water soluble, macromolecular complex of poly nuclear iron (III) hydroxide and partially hydrolysed dextrin (Polymaltose). It does not interact with the food components and other medications and so there is no decrease in bioavailability of Iron Polymaltose Complex. This makes sure that with the consumption of this complex, iron gets utilized at a faster rate in the haemoglobin synthesis. Folic acid prevents neural tube defects. Zinc is essential for many metabolic processes, blood formation, wound healing and for immune system. Thiamine is essential for the functioning of the nervous and digestive systems. Riboflavin is important for digestion, immune system support and energy production. Pyridoxin is important for brain development, production of red blood cells, metabolism of proteins and to reduce morning sickness.

Iron chelates with tetracycline and absorption may be impaired.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children below 6 years. Avoid higher doses if you have liver disease or hemochromatosis; excess can cause bloody diarrhea, vomiting, acidosis, darkened stools, abdominal pain. Symptoms may clear in a few hours. Riboflavin is reported to be completely safe and no toxic symptoms have been reported so far. Higher doses of Nicotinamide may cause vomiting, diarrhea. Sensory neuropathy was observed in individuals consuming more than 200 mg Pyridoxine for very long periods. No case of Folic acid overdose has been reported. Zinc toxicity has been seen in both acute and chronic forms.

Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient, which means it cannot be produced by the body and therefore must be obtained from diet or supplements. Ascorbic Acid has many important functions. It is required for tissue growth & repair, Adrenal gland function, enhanced immunity & healthy gums. As an antioxidant, it gives protection against harmful pollution, infection & reduces cellular damage. As a coenzyme, it is a necessary factor for wound healing, drug metabolism & metabolism of cholesterol & folic acid. As an essential nutrient, vitamin C supports healthy hair & skin, strengthens the immune system and maintain overall good health.\rDosage & Administration\rOral tablet administration:\rFor the prevention of scurvy: 1 tablet daily\rFor the treatment of scurvy: 1-2 tablets daily; but dose may be increased depending on the severity of the condition.\rFor the reduction of risk of stroke in the elderly: 1-2 tablets daily.\rIn other cases: 1 tablet daily or as directed by the physician.\rMaximum safe dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses.\rOral sachet administration: 1 sachet daily or as directed by registered physician. Maximum Dose: 2000 mg/day (4 sachets/day).\r Parenteral administration:\rVitamin C is usually administered orally. When oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected, the drug may be administered IM, IV, or subcutaneously. When given parenterally, utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after IM administration and that is the preferred parenteral route.\rFor intravenous injection, dilution into a large volume parenteral such as Normal Saline, Water for Injection, or Glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection.\rThe average protective dose of vitamin C for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily. In the presence of scurvy, doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended. However, as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity.\rTo enhance wound healing, doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate, although considerably larger amounts have been recommended. In the treatment of burns, doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury. For severe burns, daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended. In other conditions in which the need for vitamin C is increased, three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate.\rParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Ascorbic acid is incompatible in solution with aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin sodium, conjugated oestrogen, sodium bicarbonate, sulphafurazole diethanolamine, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, chlorthiazide sodium and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.\r Useful interactions: Ascorbic acid increases the apparent half-life of paracetamol and enhances iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.\rSide Effects\rCevion has little toxicity and only mega-doses of Cevion may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug is safe in normal doses in pregnant women, but a daily intake of 5 gm or more is reported to have caused abortion. The drug may be taken safely during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIngestion of megadose (more than 1000 mg daily) of Cevion during pregnancy has resulted in scurvy in neonates. Cevion in mega-doses has been contraindicated for patients with hyperoxaluria. Cevion itself is a reactive substance in the redox system and can give rise to false positive reactions in certain analytical tests for glucose, uric acid, creatine and occult blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rVitamin-C Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rShould be stored in a dry place below 30˚C.\nIndications\r\nAscorbic Acid (Cevion) is indicated in-\r\nPrevents & treats scurvy\r\nHelps in healing wounds & broken bones\r\nHelps to form collagen in connective tissues\r\nAids in iron absorption & helps to treat anemia\r\nContributes in production of hemoglobin & red blood cell in bone marrow\r\nAids in preventing many types of viral and bacterial infections and potentiates the immune system\r\nAids in the treatment & prevention of the common cold\r\nPromotes healthy capillaries, gums & teeth\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis is a preparation of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient, which means it cannot be produced by the body and therefore must be obtained from diet or supplements. Ascorbic Acid has many important functions. It is required for tissue growth & repair, Adrenal gland function, enhanced immunity & healthy gums. As an antioxidant, it gives protection against harmful pollution, infection & reduces cellular damage. As a coenzyme, it is a necessary factor for wound healing, drug metabolism & metabolism of cholesterol & folic acid. As an essential nutrient, vitamin C supports healthy hair & skin, strengthens the immune system and maintain overall good health.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOral tablet administration:\r\nFor the prevention of scurvy: 1 tablet daily\r\nFor the treatment of scurvy: 1-2 tablets daily; but dose may be increased depending on the severity of the condition.\r\nFor the reduction of risk of stroke in the elderly: 1-2 tablets daily.\r\nIn other cases: 1 tablet daily or as directed by the physician.\r\nMaximum safe dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses.\r\nOral sachet administration: 1 sachet daily or as directed by registered physician. Maximum Dose: 2000 mg/day (4 sachets/day).\r\n \nParenteral administration:\r\nVitamin C is usually administered orally. When oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected, the drug may be administered IM, IV, or subcutaneously. When given parenterally, utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after IM administration and that is the preferred parenteral route.\r\nFor intravenous injection, dilution into a large volume parenteral such as Normal Saline, Water for Injection, or Glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection.\r\nThe average protective dose of vitamin C for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily. In the presence of scurvy, doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended. However, as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity.\r\nTo enhance wound healing, doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate, although considerably larger amounts have been recommended. In the treatment of burns, doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury. For severe burns, daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended. In other conditions in which the need for vitamin C is increased, three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate.\r\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nPotentially hazardous interactions: Ascorbic acid is incompatible in solution with aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin sodium, conjugated oestrogen, sodium bicarbonate, sulphafurazole diethanolamine, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, chlorthiazide sodium and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.\r\n \nUseful interactions: Ascorbic acid increases the apparent half-life of paracetamol and enhances iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.\r\nSide Effects\r\nCevion has little toxicity and only mega-doses of Cevion may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nThe drug is safe in normal doses in pregnant women, but a daily intake of 5 gm or more is reported to have caused abortion. The drug may be taken safely during lactation.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nIngestion of megadose (more than 1000 mg daily) of Cevion during pregnancy has resulted in scurvy in neonates. Cevion in mega-doses has been contraindicated for patients with hyperoxaluria. Cevion itself is a reactive substance in the redox system and can give rise to false positive reactions in certain analytical tests for glucose, uric acid, creatine and occult blood.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nVitamin-C Preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nShould be stored in a dry place below 30˚C.",

Clinical evidence suggests that Calcium is useful for the prevention and treatment of Osteoporosis and associated fractures. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention. In this preparation, Calcium Carbonate is sourced from coral origin. This Coral Calcium has a chemical structure which is very similar to the composition of human bone. Coral Calcium is similar to other sources but ensures better absorption.

Due to increased risk of hypercalcaemia, serum calcium should be regularly monitored during concomitant use of thiazide diuretics. Systemic corticosteroids reduce calcium absorption. During concomitant use, it may be necessary to increase the dose of calcium tablet. Simultaneous treatment with ion exchange resins such as cholestyramine or laxatives such as paraffin oil may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D. Calcium carbonate may interfere with the absorption of concomitantly administered tetracycline preparations. For this reason, tetracycline preparations should be administered at least two hours before, or four to six hours after, oral intake of calcium. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D. Patients should be monitored with regard to electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum calcium levels. If a bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride is used concomitantly, Seacal-D should be administered at least three hours before the intake of calcium tablet since gastrointestinal absorption may be reduced. Oxalic acid (found in spinach and rhubarb) and phytic acid (found in whole cereals) may inhibit calcium absorption through formation of insoluble calcium salts. The patient should not take calcium products within two hours of eating foods high in oxalic acid and phytic acid.\rContraindications\rHypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism\rHypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis\rHypersensitivity to the component of this preparation\rSevere renal insufficiencies\rConcomitant digoxin therapy (requires careful monitoring of serum Calcium level)\rSide Effects\rOrally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcemia is rarely produced by administration of Calcium alone but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure. Also there may be allergic reactions, irregular heartbeats, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite dry mouth and drowsiness. Following administration of Vitamin D Supplements occasion skin rash has been reported.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rDuring pregnancy the daily intake should not exceed 1500 mg calcium and 600 IU cholecalciferol (15 mcg vitamin D). Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity with high dose of vitamin D. In pregnant women, overdoses of calcium and vitamin D should be avoided as permanent hypercalcaemia has been related to adverse effects on the developing foetus. There are no indications that vitamin D at therapeutic doses is teratogenic in humans. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet can be used during pregnancy, in case of a calcium and vitamin D deficiency. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet can be used during breast-feeding. Calcium and vitamin D3 pass into breast milk. This should be considered when giving additional vitamin D to the child.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rDuring long-term treatment, serum calcium levels should be followed and renal function should be monitored through measurement of serum creatinine. Monitoring is especially important in elderly patients on concomitant treatment with cardiac glycosides or diuretics and in patients with a high tendency to calculus formation. In case of hypercalcaemia or signs of impaired renal function, the dose should be reduced or the treatment discontinued. Vitamin D should be used with caution in patients with impairment of renal function and the effect on calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored. The risk of soft tissue calcification should be taken into account. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol is not metabolised normally and other forms of vitamin D should be used. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be prescribed with caution to patients suffering from sarcoidosis because of the risk of increased metabolism of vitamin D to its active metabolite. In these patients, serum calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion must be monitored. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be used with caution in immobilised patients with osteoporosis due to the increased risk of hypercalcaemia. The dose of vitamin D in Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be considered when prescribing other drugs containing vitamin D. Additional doses of calcium or vitamin D should be taken under close medical supervision. In such cases it is necessary to monitor serum calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion frequently.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdose can lead to hypervitaminosis D and hypercalcaemia. Symptoms of hypercalcaemia may include anorexia, thirst, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, mental disturbances, polydipsia, polyuria, bone pain, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias. Extreme hypercalcaemia may result in coma and death. Persistently high calcium levels may lead to irreversible renal damage and soft tissue calcification. Treatment of hypercalcaemia: The treatment with calcium must be discontinued. Treatment with thiazide diuretics, lithium, vitamin A and cardiac glycosides must also be discontinued. Emptying of the stomach in patients with impaired consciousness. Rehydration, and, according to severity, isolated or combined treatment with loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, calcitonin and corticosteroids. Serum electrolytes, renal function and diuresis must be monitored. In severe cases, ECG and CVP should be followed.\rTherapeutic Class\rSpecific mineral & vitamin combined preparations\rStorage Conditions\rStore at temperature of below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

In pregnant women, overdoses of calcium and vitamin D should be avoided as permanent hypercalcaemia has been related to adverse effects on the developing foetus. There are no indications that vitamin D at therapeutic doses is teratogenic in humans. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet can be used during pregnancy, in case of a calcium and vitamin D deficiency. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet can be used during breast-feeding. Calcium and vitamin D3 pass into breast milk. This should be considered when giving additional vitamin D to the child.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nDuring long-term treatment, serum calcium levels should be followed and renal function should be monitored through measurement of serum creatinine. Monitoring is especially important in elderly patients on concomitant treatment with cardiac glycosides or diuretics and in patients with a high tendency to calculus formation. In case of hypercalcaemia or signs of impaired renal function, the dose should be reduced or the treatment discontinued. Vitamin D should be used with caution in patients with impairment of renal function and the effect on calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored. The risk of soft tissue calcification should be taken into account. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol is not metabolised normally and other forms of vitamin D should be used. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be prescribed with caution to patients suffering from sarcoidosis because of the risk of increased metabolism of vitamin D to its active metabolite. In these patients, serum calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion must be monitored. Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be used with caution in immobilised patients with osteoporosis due to the increased risk of hypercalcaemia. The dose of vitamin D in Elemental Calcium & Vitamin D3 tablet should be considered when prescribing other drugs containing vitamin D. Additional doses of calcium or vitamin D should be taken under close medical supervision. In such cases it is necessary to monitor serum calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion frequently.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nOverdose can lead to hypervitaminosis D and hypercalcaemia. Symptoms of hypercalcaemia may include anorexia, thirst, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, mental disturbances, polydipsia, polyuria, bone pain, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias. Extreme hypercalcaemia may result in coma and death. Persistently high calcium levels may lead to irreversible renal damage and soft tissue calcification. Treatment of hypercalcaemia: The treatment with calcium must be discontinued. Treatment with thiazide diuretics, lithium, vitamin A and cardiac glycosides must also be discontinued. Emptying of the stomach in patients with impaired consciousness. Rehydration, and, according to severity, isolated or combined treatment with loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, calcitonin and corticosteroids. Serum electrolytes, renal function and diuresis must be monitored. In severe cases, ECG and CVP should be followed.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nSpecific mineral & vitamin combined preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore at temperature of below 30°C, protect from light & moisture.

The formulation contains essential antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and Lutein.\rComposition\rEach capsule contains -\rVitamin C 60 mg\rVitamin E 30 mg\rLutein Ph.grade 6 mg\rCopper (as Cupric oxide) Ph.grade 2 mg\rZinc (as Zinc oxide) BP 15 mg\rPharmacology\rVitamin C is highly concentrated in the lens compared to blood. A long term Vitamin C supplement use (10+ years) has been associated with reduced risk of cataract. Vitamin C has an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.\r In study, it is found that high serum Vitamin E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established). As an antioxidant vitamin, it also plays an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.\r Lutein is a carotenoid, specially concentrated in the macula. Clinical and animaldata indicates that this caretenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage.\r Although exact mechanism of action is not clear but onelarge study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein is associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzymes system.\r Symptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.\r Copper plays important role in growth, skeletal integrity, and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part in numerous metabolic conversions.\rDosage & Administration\rOne capsule, one or two times daily or as directed by the physician\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo drug interaction has been reported.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\rSide Effects\rLarge doses of Vitamin C are reported to cause diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disturbances.

The formulation contains essential antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and Lutein.\r\nComposition\r\nEach capsule contains -\r\nVitamin C 60 mg\r\nVitamin E 30 mg\r\nLutein Ph.grade 6 mg\r\nCopper (as Cupric oxide) Ph.grade 2 mg\r\nZinc (as Zinc oxide) BP 15 mg\r\nPharmacology\r\nVitamin C is highly concentrated in the lens compared to blood. A long term Vitamin C supplement use (10+ years) has been associated with reduced risk of cataract. Vitamin C has an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.\r\n \nIn study, it is found that high serum Vitamin E concentrations have been associated with reduced risk of cataract (exact mechanism of action is not still established). As an antioxidant vitamin, it also plays an important role in harmful free radicals scavenging activity.\r\n \nLutein is a carotenoid, specially concentrated in the macula. Clinical and animaldata indicates that this caretenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage.\r\n \nAlthough exact mechanism of action is not clear but onelarge study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein is associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzymes system.\r\n \nSymptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.\r\n \nCopper plays important role in growth, skeletal integrity, and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part in numerous metabolic conversions.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOne capsule, one or two times daily or as directed by the physician\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo drug interaction has been reported.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nLarge doses of Vitamin C are reported to cause diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disturbances.

During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatment\r\n \nVitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPlasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nThe safety & efficacy of Vitamin D3 in children under 12 years have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIt can lead to hypervitaminosis D.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nVitamin in bone formation, Vitamin-D preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30º C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle; it has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle than on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, decreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac demand by reducing afterload.\r Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dosage is Amlodipine and Atenolol 5/25 mg tablet once daily.

Iron Polymaltose Complex is a water soluble, macromolecular complex of poly nuclear iron (III) hydroxide and partially hydrolysed dextrin (Polymaltose). It does not interact with the food components and other medications and so there is no decrease in bioavailability of Iron Polymaltose Complex. This makes sure that with the consumption of this complex, iron gets utilized at a faster rate in the haemoglobin synthesis. Folic acid prevents neural tube defects. Zinc is essential for many metabolic processes, blood formation, wound healing and for immune system. Thiamine is essential for the functioning of the nervous and digestive systems. Riboflavin is important for digestion, immune system support and energy production. Pyridoxin is important for brain development, production of red blood cells, metabolism of proteins and to reduce morning sickness. Nicotinamide is important for energy, blood pressure and circulation.\rDosage & Administration\rOne capsule daily.

        "description": "Indications\rAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): It is indicated to reduce the rate of Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Stroke in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)] and acute ST-segment elevation ACS [ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)].\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent Myocardial Infarction (MI) or recent Stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and Stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen at 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\r Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibiting the generation of thromboxane A2 a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\r Pharmacokinetics: After repeated 75-mg oral doses of Clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.00025 mg/L) beyond 2 hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main circulating metabolite is the carboxylic acid derivative, and it has no effect on platelet aggregation. It represents about 85% of the circulating drug-related compounds in plasma. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% is excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the faeces in the 5 days after dosing. The elimination half-life of the main circulating metabolite is 8 hours after single and repeated administration. Administration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.\r Absorption and Distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses\rof 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of Clopidogrel.\rAbsorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of Clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 g/mL.\r Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without food. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina/non-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 mg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rStudy of specific drug interactions yielded the following results:\r Aspirin: Aspirin does not modify the Clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel potentiates the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced platelet aggregation.\r Heparin: Clopidogrel does not necessitate modification of the heparin dose or alter the effect of heparin on coagulation. Co-administration of heparin has no effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by Clopidogrel.\r Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Concomitant administration of Clopidogrel is associated with increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. NSAIDs and Clopidogrel should be co-administered with caution.\r Warfarin: The safety of the co-administration of Clopidogrel with warfarin has not been established. Consequently, concomitant administration of these two agents should be undertaken with caution.\rContraindications\rThis combination is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rClocard-A is generally well tolerated.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during first and second trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is unknown whether Clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk but Aspirin is known to be excreted in human milk. This Drug should be discontinued during the breast feeding.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rClocard-A may prolongs the bleeding time.\rThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported rarely following use of Clocard-A.\rReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome may develop in individuals who have chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving Clocard-A or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines\rUse in Special Populations\rIt should not be given to children, particularly those under 12 years, unless the expected benefits outweight the possible risks. Aspirin may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye’s syndrome in some children.\rOverdose Effects\rClopidogrel overdose may lead to bleeding complications. Based on biological plausibility, platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. In moderate aspirin intoxication dizziness, headache, tinnitus, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur which can be treated by inducing vomiting followed by gastric lavage if needed. In severe Aspirin intoxication respiratory alkalosis respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, perspiration, dehydration can occur. It can be treated with haemodialysis and other symptomatic treatment.\rTherapeutic Class\rAnti-platelet drugs\rStorage Conditions\rKeep in a cool & dry place (below 30ºC), protected from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rBisoprolol plus Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in the treatment of Hypertension.\rPharmacology\rBisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide have been used individually and in combination for the treatment of hypertension. The antihypertensive effects of these agents are additive; Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg significantly increases the antihypertensive effect of Bisoprolol Fumarate. The incidence of hypokalemia with the Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg combination is significantly lower than with Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Bisoprolol Fumarate is a β1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent without significant membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic activities in its therapeutic dose range. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazine diuretic. Thiazides affect renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption and increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts\rDosage & Administration\rBisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of Bisoprolol/Hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using Bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.\r Initial Therapy: Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of this conbination, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with this tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg once daily, as appropriate.\r Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.\r Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg Bisoprolol daily may instead be given this conbination. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to this conbination.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rAncor Plus drug may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Ancor Plus drug should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of Bisoprolol Fumarate may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that Ancor Plus drug be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine. Ancor Plus drug should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes) or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients in cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, anuria and hypersensitivity to either component of this product or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. Most side effects have been mild and transient. Side effects which may occur: fatigue, dizziness, headache, bradycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, cold extremities, claudication, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis, pharyngitis etc.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rUse in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol Fumarate and Hydrochlorothiazide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.\r Use in Nursing Mothers: Bisoprolol Fumarate alone or in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in nursing mothers. Thiazides are excreted in human breast milk. Small amounts of Bisoprolol Fumarate have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop. If withdrawal of Ancor Plus therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.\rOverdose Effects\rThere are limited data on overdose with Ancor Plus product. The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined antihypertensive preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Zinc supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. Zinc also has some antioxidant properties. Zinc is used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder) in children. In adult, due to zinc deficiency loss of appetite, poor sense of taste and smell, tendency towards depression, white marks on fingernails, frequent infections, low fertility, prostate problems, mental problems, poor wound healing, a poor immune system, diarrhoea, mental lethargy, rough skin and weight loss may occur.\r B-Vitamins are needed to release energy from food. They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination.

        "description": "Indications\rTenoloc is indicated-\rIn the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\rFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\rIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\rPharmacology\rThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a β-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block β1 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on β2-receptors. It is classified as a β1 selective (cardioselective) β-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available β- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r Angina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r Acute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Tenoloc plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\rCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Tenoloc.\rDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\rAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\rBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\rConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\rWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.\rBoth digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.\rContraindications\rAtenolol is contraindicated in-\rSinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.\rThose patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the atenolol or any of the drug product’s components.\rSide Effects\rIn a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly, as expected for any beta blocker. In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Tenoloc.\rHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\rAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\rCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\rGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\rMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\rOther: Erythematous rash\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Tenoloc is administered. Initial and subsequent Tenoloc dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Tenoloc may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.\r Impaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.\r Geriatric Use:\rHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\rAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment: Tenoloc is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, refecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renal impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes:\rCreatinine clearance 15-35 ml/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 50 mg daily\rCreatinine clearance <15 mL/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 25 mg daily\rSome renal impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of Tenoloc: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage with Tenoloc has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following Tenoloc overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common efects associated with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in Tenoloc overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Tenoloc can be removed from the general circulation by hemodialysis. Based on the severity of symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.\rTherapeutic Class\rBeta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, Beta-blockers\rStorage Conditions\rDo not use later than the date of expiry. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children. To be dispensed only on the prescription of a registered physician.\nIndications\r\nTenoloc is indicated-\r\nIn the management of hypertension.

It may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, particularly with a thiazide-type diuretic.\rFor the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.\rIn the management of hemodynamically stable patients with defnite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\rPharmacology\rThe synthesis of atenolol resulted from attempts to produce a β-adrenoceptor antagonist that would competitively block β1 (cardiac) receptors but have no effect on β2-receptors. It is classified as a β1 selective (cardioselective) β-adrenergic receptor antagonist with no membranestability activity and no partial agonist activity. It is markedly the most hydrophilic of the currently available β- blockers and thus penetrates the lipid of cell membranes poorly\rDosage & Administration\rHypertension: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.\r Angina Pectoris: The initial dose of Atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to Atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.\r Acute Myocardial Infarction: In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with Atenolol I.V. Injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg Atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), Atenolol Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, Atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6-9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, Atenolol should be discontinued.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCatecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with Tenoloc plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.\rCalcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with Tenoloc.\rDisopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers.\rAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers.\rBeta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.\rConcomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.\rWhile taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic.

In addition, a variety of adverse efects has been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered potential adverse efects of Tenoloc.\rHematologic: Agranulocytosis.\rAllergic: Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.\rCentral Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics.\rGastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis.\rMiscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy.\rOther: Erythematous rash\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. Caution should be exercised when Atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast-fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rGeneral: Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before Tenoloc is administered. Initial and subsequent Tenoloc dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Tenoloc may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.\r Impaired Renal Function: The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.\r Geriatric Use:\rHypertension and Angina Pectoris: Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\rAcute Myocardial Infarction: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function.\rUse in Special Populations\rElderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment: Tenoloc is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, refecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renal impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes:\rCreatinine clearance 15-35 ml/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 50 mg daily\rCreatinine clearance <15 mL/min/1.73 m2: Maximum dosage 25 mg daily\rSome renal impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of Tenoloc: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.\rOverdose Effects\rOverdosage with Tenoloc has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following Tenoloc overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common efects associated with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in Tenoloc overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia.

        "description": "Indications\rOrbas is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.\rDosage & Administration\rDosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.\r No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food.\r Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which Orbas was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of olmesartan was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids. Orbas is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effects on P450 enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce, or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Orbas, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving Orbas and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Orbas may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.\rContraindications\rOlmesartan is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.\rSide Effects\rOrbas has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Orbas was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Orbas and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Orbas and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Orbas and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%)\r The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Orbas, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of cough was similar in placebo (0.7%) and Orbas (0.9%) patients.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWhen pregnancy is detected, discontinue this product as soon as possible. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Orbas. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Orbas.\rOverdose Effects\rThere is no experience of overdose with Orbas. The most likely effects of Orbas overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Orbas requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rStore in cool & dry place below 30ºC, protect from light & moisture.

Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Orbas.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nThere is no experience of overdose with Orbas. The most likely effects of Orbas overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Orbas requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nStore in cool & dry place below 30ºC, protect from light & moisture.

Orbapin drug is indicated as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.

Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.\rOlmenor-am - MedEx campaign banner\rOlmedip - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rAmlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.\r Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension.

        "description": "Indications\rHypertension: Losart is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r Renal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Losart is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\rPharmacology\rLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\rDosage & Administration\rThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r Patients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r Patients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losart. Concomitant use of Losart and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\rContraindications\rLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\rSide Effects\rThe side effects with the use of Losart are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rUse of Losart during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losart is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r Use in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losart is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan. Warnings: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate significantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients, a lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan; these changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Losart should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics.\rTherapeutic Class\rAngiotensin-ll receptor blocker\rStorage Conditions\rkeep in a dry place away from light and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nHypertension: Losart is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (eg. thiazide diuretics).\r\n \nRenal Protection in Type-2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria: Losart is indicated to delay the progression of renal disease in hypertensive type-2 diabetics with proteinuria, defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio >300 mg/g.\r\nPharmacology\r\nLosartan Potassium is the first non-peptide orally active angiotensin II receptor blocker. It binds to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidneys and the heart) and reduces several important biological actions including vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone responsible for hypertension.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe usual starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily for most patients. If the antihypertensive effect using 50 mg once daily is inadequate, 25 mg twice daily is recommended prior to increasing the dose. For patients with intravascular volume-depletion (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg once daily should be considered. Losartan Potassium can be administered once or twice daily. The total daily dose ranges from 25 mg to 100 mg.\r\n \nPatients upto 75 years: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for this group of patients.\r\n \nPatients over 75 years: Presently there is limited clinical experience in this group; a lower starting dose of 25 mg once daily is recommended.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nRifampicin and fluconazole reduce levels of active metabolite of Losart. Concomitant use of Losart and hydrochlorothiazide may lead to potentiation of the antihypertensive effects. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. The antihypertensive effect of losartan may be attenuated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. The use of ACE-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, an anti-inflammatory drug and a thiazide diuretic at the same time increases the risk of renal impairment.\r\nContraindications\r\nLosartan Potassium is contraindicated in pregnant women and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Losartan Potassium should not be administered with Aliskiren in patients with diabetes.\r\nSide Effects\r\nThe side effects with the use of Losart are mild and transient in nature. The most common side effects are dizziness, diarrhea, nasal congestion, cough, upper respiratory infection. Other side effects are fatigue, oedema, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, headache & pharyngitis.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nPregnancy Category D. The risk to the fetus increases if Losartan Potassium is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. It is not known whether Losartan Potassium is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nUse of Losart during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Plasma concentration of Losart is significantly increased in cirrhotic patients. Changes in renal function including renal failure have been reported in renal impaired patient.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in renal impairment: No initial dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min). For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e. creatinine clearance <20 ml/min) or patients on dialysis, a lower starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended. Use in patients with intravascular volume depletion: For the very small proportion of patients who have intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), a starting dose of 25 mg (one Araten-50 tablet) once daily is recommended.\r\n \nUse in hepatic impairment: A lower dose should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Araten may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Araten may be administered with or without food.Contra-indications, warnings, etc. Contra-indications: Losart is contra-indicated in pregnancy and in patients who are hypersensitive to losartan.

        "description": "Indications\rLosart Plus is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\rPharmacology\rAngiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\r Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\rDosage\rHypertension-\rThe usual starting dose of this combination 50/12.5 is one tablet once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to one tablet the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily.\rA patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Losartan 100 mg monotherapy may be switched to this combination 100/12.5 once daily.\rIn hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy initial dose is 50/12.5, if additional blood pressure reduction is needed, 100/12.5 may be given, followed by 100/25 if required. The maximum dose is 100/25 once daily.\rIn general, the antihypertensive effect is attained within three weeks after initiation of therapy.\rNo initial dosage adjustment of 50/12.5 is necessary for elderly patients. But maximum dose of 100/25 once daily dose should not be used as initial therapy in elderly patients.\rSevere Hypertension:\rThe starting dose for initial treatment of severe hypertension is one tablet of 50/12.5 once daily.\rFor patients who do not respond adequately to this dose after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to 100/25 once daily. The maximum dose is one tablet of 100/25 once daily.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rThis preparation may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

As with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. Spironolactone, Triamterene, Amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r Other antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\rContraindications\rThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\rSide Effects\rSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\rPregnancy & Lactation\rAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\rPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\rHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\rImpaired renal function and\rSymptomatic hypotension\rUse in Special Populations\rUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r Use in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\rOverdose Effects\rLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans.

As with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of Losartan may be blunted by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Indomethacin.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with Thiazide diuretics: alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\r\n \nAntidiabetic drugs (oral agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\r\n \nOther antihypertensive drugs: additive effect or potentiation.\r\n \nCholestyramine and colestipol resins: absorption of Hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins\r\nContraindications\r\nThe combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSide-effects are usually mild. Symptomatic hypotension including dizziness may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. those taking high-dose diuretics). Hyperkalaemia occurs occasionally; angioedema has also been reported with some angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Vertigo; less commonly gastro-intestinal disturbances, angina, palpitation, oedema, dyspnoea, headache, sleep disorders, malaise, urticaria, pruritus, rash; rarely hepatitis, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, syncope, paraesthesia; also reported pancreatitis, anaphylaxis, cough, depression, erectile dysfunction, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia, arthralgia, myalgia, renal impairment, rhabdomyolysis, tinnitus, photosensitivity, and vasculitis (including Henoch-Schonlein purpura)\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nAngiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy unless essential. They may adversely affect fetal and neonatal blood pressure control and renal function; skull defects and oligohy dramnios have also been reported. Information on the use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists in breastfeeding is limited. They are not recommended in breastfeeding and alternative treatment options, with better-established safety information during breastfeeding, are available.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nHypersensitivity: Angiooedema\r\nPeriodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals\r\nHypokalemia may rarely develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy\r\nImpaired renal function and\r\nSymptomatic hypotension\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nUse in Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with 50/12.5 may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 ml/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides. In that case, hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended.\r\n \nUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The combination of Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide is not recommended for titration in patients with hepatic impairment because the appropriate 25 mg starting dose of Losartan cannot be given.\r\n \nUse in pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nLosartan Potassium: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Neither losartan nor its metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis.\r\n \nHydrochlorothiazide: The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia, may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which Hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nCombined antihypertensive preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nDo not store above 30°C.

It is reported to be useful in elderly patients and in those with diabetes and albuminuria. Duocard has been increasingly used in patients with chronic kidney disease\r Hypertension is the term used to describe the presence of high blood pressure. The blood pressure is generated by the force of the blood pumped from the heart against the blood vessels. Thus hypertension is caused when there is too much pressure on the blood vessels and this effect can damage the blood vessel\rPharmacology\rCilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. Cilnidipine binds to the dihydropy-ridine binding sites of the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel and inhibits Ca2+ influx across the cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells via this channel, consequently vascular smooth muscle is relaxed, causing vasodilation.

Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor capsule: Adults:\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day.

It is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\r Recent MI, recent Stroke, or established Peripheral Arterial Disease: In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke it is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.\rPharmacology\rClopidogrel is a prodrug. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses. Repeated doses of 75 mg per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.\rDosage & Administration\rAcute Coronary Syndrome: In patients who need an antiplatelet effect within hours, initiate clopidogrel with a single 300 mg (4 tablets) oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiating it without a loading dose will delay establishment of an antiplatelet effect by several days.\r Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease: 75 mg once daily orally without a loading dose.\r It is given orally with or without food.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNSAIDs, warfarin, selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, SNRIs): Increases risk of bleeding\rCYP2C19 inhibitors (omeprazole or esomeprazole): Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole\rRepaglinide (CYP2C8 substrates): Avoid concomitant use of Dclot with Repaglinide as it increases plasma concentrations of Repaglinide\rContraindications\rClopidogrel is contraindicated in the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the product. Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.\rSide Effects\rDclot is generally well tolerated drug.\rCommon side effects: Bleeding, Diarrhoea, gastrointestinal discomfort, haemorrhage, Skin reactions.\rRare side effects: Acquired haemophilia, anaemia, angioedema, arthralgia, arthritis, bone marrow disorders.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is unknown whether clopidogrel is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rAs it is a prodrug, so metabolism to its active metabolite is impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 (poor metabolizer) and by the drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 such as Omeprazole and Esomeprazole. Concomitant use with these drugs and in CYP2C19 poor metaboliser may reduce the antiplatelet activity of Dclot.\rAs it inhibits platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), risk of bleeding may increase. To restore hemostasis, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\rDiscontinuation of Dclot increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume Dclot as soon as hemostasis is achieved.\rThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been reported that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).\rHypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel or history of hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.\rUse in Special Populations\rSafety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been established.

Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor capsule: Adults:\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day.

A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor capsule: Adults:\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day.

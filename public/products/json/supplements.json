        "description": "Indications\rIt is indicated on prophylaxis of iron deficiency especially when inadequate diet calls for supplementary zinc and iron during pregnancy and anemia.\rDescription\rIt is an oral iron, folic acid and zinc preparation indicated for the treatment of iron, folic acid and zinc deficiency.\rPharmacology\rFerrous Ascorbate, Folic Acid & Zinc is a combination of three nutritional supplements. Ferrous Ascorbate is a combination of iron and vitamin C. Iron replenishes the iron stores in your body and corrects iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is added to enhance the absorption of iron in the body. Folic Acid is a form of vitamin B. It plays a vital role in the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. It is also essential in pregnancy due to its role in the development of the unborn baby's brain and spinal cord. Zinc is a micromineral that provides nutrition.\rDosage & Administration\rAdult & Elderly: One tablet a day before or after meal (food independent absorption) or as directed by the physician. In more severe cases, two tablets a day may be required as prescribed by the physician.\r Pediatric patients: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIron chelates with tetracycline. Since oral iron products interfere with absorption of oral tetracycline antibiotics, Hemofix FZ should not be taken within two hours of each other. Occasional gastrointestinal discomfort may be minimized by taking with meals. Absorption of iron may be impaired by concurrent administrations of penicillamine and antacid. In patients with renal failure, a risk of zinc accumulation may exist.\rContraindications\rIt is contraindicated in patients with haemolytic anaemia and in conditions with increased hypersensitivity to any of its components and increased body iron content.\rSide Effects\rSide effects of iron, folic acid and zinc supplementation are mild and transient. These include epigastric pain, nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, heart burn, etc. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rIf pregnant, or planning to become pregnant or are currently breast-feeding please contact your physician, before taking or continuing the drug. Administration in first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided unless definite evidence of iron deficiency is observed. Prophylaxis of iron deficiency is justified during the remainder of pregnancy specifically when zinc supplementation is required.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken in patients who may develop iron overload, such as those with haemochromatosis, haemolytic anemia or red cell aplasia. Failure to respond to treatment may indicate other causes of anemia and should be further investigated.\rOverdose Effects\rThe clinical course of acute iron overdosage can be variable. Initial symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tarry stools, melena, hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, dehydration, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, shock and coma.\rTherapeutic Class\rIron, Vitamin & Mineral Combined preparation\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium.

Ascorbic Acid is an essential nutrient, which means it cannot be produced by the body and therefore must be obtained from diet or supplements. Ascorbic Acid has many important functions. It is required for tissue growth & repair, Adrenal gland function, enhanced immunity & healthy gums. As an antioxidant, it gives protection against harmful pollution, infection & reduces cellular damage. As a coenzyme, it is a necessary factor for wound healing, drug metabolism & metabolism of cholesterol & folic acid. As an essential nutrient, vitamin C supports healthy hair & skin, strengthens the immune system and maintain overall good health.\rDosage & Administration\rOral tablet administration:\rFor the prevention of scurvy: 1 tablet daily\rFor the treatment of scurvy: 1-2 tablets daily; but dose may be increased depending on the severity of the condition.\rFor the reduction of risk of stroke in the elderly: 1-2 tablets daily.\rIn other cases: 1 tablet daily or as directed by the physician.\rMaximum safe dose is 2000 mg daily in divided doses.\rOral sachet administration: 1 sachet daily or as directed by registered physician. Maximum Dose: 2000 mg/day (4 sachets/day).\r Parenteral administration:\rVitamin C is usually administered orally. When oral administration is not feasible or when malabsorption is suspected, the drug may be administered IM, IV, or subcutaneously. When given parenterally, utilization of the vitamin reportedly is best after IM administration and that is the preferred parenteral route.\rFor intravenous injection, dilution into a large volume parenteral such as Normal Saline, Water for Injection, or Glucose is recommended to minimize the adverse reactions associated with intravenous injection.\rThe average protective dose of vitamin C for adults is 70 to 150 mg daily. In the presence of scurvy, doses of 300 mg to 1 g daily are recommended. However, as much as 6 g has been administered parenterally to normal adults without evidence of toxicity.\rTo enhance wound healing, doses of 300 to 500 mg daily for a week or ten days both preoperatively and postoperatively are generally considered adequate, although considerably larger amounts have been recommended. In the treatment of burns, doses are governed by the extent of tissue injury. For severe burns, daily doses of 1 to 2 g are recommended. In other conditions in which the need for vitamin C is increased, three to five times the daily optimum allowances appear to be adequate.\rParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rPotentially hazardous interactions: Ascorbic acid is incompatible in solution with aminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, lactobionate, nafcillin, nitrofurantoin sodium, conjugated oestrogen, sodium bicarbonate, sulphafurazole diethanolamine, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, chlorthiazide sodium and hydrocortisone sodium succinate.\r Useful interactions: Ascorbic acid increases the apparent half-life of paracetamol and enhances iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.\rSide Effects\rNutrivit-C has little toxicity and only mega-doses of Nutrivit-C may cause diarrhoea, abdominal bloating, iron over-absorption that is harmful in patients with thalassaemia, sideroblastic anemia, and haemochromatosis; hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, and hemolysis in patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. A pregnant woman taking more than 5 gm/day may suffer fetal abortion.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rThe drug is safe in normal doses in pregnant women, but a daily intake of 5 gm or more is reported to have caused abortion. The drug may be taken safely during lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rIngestion of megadose (more than 1000 mg daily) of Nutrivit-C during pregnancy has resulted in scurvy in neonates. Nutrivit-C in mega-doses has been contraindicated for patients with hyperoxaluria. Nutrivit-C itself is a reactive substance in the redox system and can give rise to false positive reactions in certain analytical tests for glucose, uric acid, creatine and occult blood.\rTherapeutic Class\rVitamin-C Preparations\rStorage Conditions\rShould be stored in a dry place below 30˚C.\nIndications\r\nAscorbic Acid (Nutrivit-C) is indicated in-\r\nPrevents & treats scurvy\r\nHelps in healing wounds & broken bones\r\nHelps to form collagen in connective tissues\r\nAids in iron absorption & helps to treat anemia\r\nContributes in production of hemoglobin & red blood cell in bone marrow\r\nAids in preventing many types of viral and bacterial infections and potentiates the immune system\r\nAids in the treatment & prevention of the common cold\r\nPromotes healthy capillaries, gums & teeth\r\nPharmacology\r\nThis is a preparation of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).

        "description": "Indications\rVitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rBrain-stroke - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium.

Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\rDosage & Administration\rFor capsule: Adults:\rTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks.

It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience. Typical dosage recommendation, based on body weight is as follows-\rUnder 54 Kg: 1000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 800 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r54 Kg to 91 Kg: 1500 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1200 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\rOver 91 Kg: 2000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1600 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day.\r750/600 mg tablet: 1 tablet two times daily or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere have been no reports of significant drug interactions of Glucosamine and Chondroitin with Antibiotics/ Antidepressants/ Antihypertensives/ Nitrates/ Antiarrythmics/ Anxiolytics/ Hypoglycemic agents/ Antisecretives/ Antiasthmatics. Chondroitin may enhance the blood thinning effects of anticoagulants like Warfarin, Heparin.\rContraindications\rThere are no known contraindications for Glucosamine and Chondroitin. But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\rSide Effects\rSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate. Glucosamine and Chondroitin has not been studied enough to determine their effects on a developing fetus. No studies have evaluated the use of Glucosamine and Chondroitin during pregnancy or lactation. It should be taken with caution and medical advice during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with Diabetes Mellitus are advised to monitor blood glucose levels regularly when taking Glucosamine. No special studies were formed in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. The toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile of Glucosamine and Chondroitin does not indicate limitations for these patients. However, administration to patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency should be under appropriate medical supervision. Children should not be supplemented with Glucosamine and Chondroitin.\rTherapeutic Class\rStimulation of Cartilage formation\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement.

It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate.

        "description": "Indications\rAlendronic Acid & Vitamin D3 is indicated in:\rTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\rTreatment of osteoporosis in men.\rTreatment of osteoporosis as it increases the bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine.\rPharmacology\rAlendronate Sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Alendronate is effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. It transiently distributes to soft tissues following administration but is then rapidly distributed to bone or excreted in the urine. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. There is no evidence that Alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans. At the cellular level, Alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specially under osteoclasts. It inhibits osteoclast activity. In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. Vitamin D is required for normal bone formation. Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate. Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, increased parathyroid hormone levels, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture.\rDosage\rTreatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women: The recommended dosage is-\r70 mg alendronate and 2800 IU vitamin D3 or\r70 mg alendronate and 5600 IU vitamin D3 tablet once weekly.\rFor most osteoporotic women, the appropriate dose is 70 mg alendronate and 5600 IU vitamin D3 once weekly.\rTreatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis: The recommended dosage is-\r70 mg alendronate and 2800 IU vitamin D3 or\r70 mg alendronate and 5600 IU D3 tablet once weekly.\rFor most osteoporotic men, the appropriate dose is 70 mg alendronate and 5600 IU vitamin D3 once weekly.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rTo permit adequate absorption, Alendronate & Colecalciferol must be taken at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage or medication of the day with plain water only. Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of Alendronate. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus to reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Alendronate & Colecalciferol tablet should only be swallowed upon rising for the day with a full glass of water. Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate until after their first food of the day. Alendronate & Colecalciferol should not be taken at bed time.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rCalcium supplement, antacids and some oral medications will interfere with absorption of Alendronate if taken at the same time. Intravenous ranitidine makes the bioavailability of oral Alendronate double. Incidence of upper gastro-intestinal adverse events associated with NSAID and aspirin appears to be greater with concomitant administration of Alendronate. Mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D. Anticonvulsants, cimetidine, and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.\rContraindications\rAbnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia.\rInability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.\rHypersensitivity to any component of this product.\rHypocalcaemia.\rSide Effects\rUsually mild and generally do not require discontinuation of therapy. Side effects include esophageal reactions, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhoea or constipation, flatulence, musculoskeletal pain, headache, rash, erythema and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy category C. Overdoses of vitamin D have shown teratogenic effects in pregnant animals. Alendronic Acid & Vitamin D3 (Colecalciferol) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Cholecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk. It is not known whether alendronate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administered to lactating women.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypocalcaemia and other disturbances of mineral metabolism should be corrected before initiation of therapy. Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastro-intestinal mucosa. Caution should be used when Alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems such as dysphagia, esophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers. Patients should stop taking medicine and consult their physician if they develop esophageal diseases.\rUse in Special Populations\rDosing in elderly and renal insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min). Alendronic Acid + Vitamin D3 (Colecalciferol) is not recommended for patients with more severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance<35 mL/min) due to lack of experience.\rOverdose Effects\rHypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdosage.  Signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, and lethargy.\rTherapeutic Class\rCombined preparations: Inhibiting bone resorption\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place. Protect from light & moisture. Keep out of the reach of children.\nIndications\r\nAlendronic Acid & Vitamin D3 is indicated in:\r\nTreatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.\r\nTreatment of osteoporosis in men.\r\nTreatment of osteoporosis as it increases the bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine.\r\nPharmacology\r\nAlendronate Sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption.

        "description": "Indications\rThis Kit is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in women (especially after menopause) & men. It increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures.\rDescription\rIbandronic Acid is a group of medicine called bisphosphonates. It alters the cycle of bone formation and break down in the body. It slows bone loss while increasing bones mass, which may prevent bone fracture. Ibandronic Acid has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as a hydroxyapatite agent. At the cellular level, Ibandronic Acid inhibits osteoclast. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but show evidence of reduce active resorption.\r Osteoporosis: Human body constantly breaking down old bone and making new bone tissue. If people have osteoporosis, their body breaks down more bones than it forms. So that gradually bone loss occurs and bones become thinner and fragile. This is especially common in women after the menopause. Many people with osteoporosis have no symptom and may not even know that they have it. However, osteoporosis makes them more likely to have fractures, especially in spine, hips and wrists.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet of Ibandronic Acid 150 mg once monthly of the same date of each month is recommended. To maximize the clinical benefit of Ibandronic Acid, two tablets of Calcium Orotate per day are usually recommended in divided dosage.\r To maximize absorption and clinical benefit, Ibandronic Acid tablet of this Kit should be taken at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins.\r To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Ibandronic Acid tablet should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (250 ml) while the patient is standing or sitting in an upright position.

Stresses and strains of today's life are causing hypertension, diabetes, heart disorders, depression, memory loss and arthritis to the elderly. Some of the declines seniors experience may not be totally age related, but may be caused by poor nutrition, unhealthy eating habits. Research has shown that many times adults fail to get the balanced nutrition that is necessary for proper and healthy bodily functions.

        "description": "Indications\rIndicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement. It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience. Typical dosage recommendation, based on body weight is as follows-\rUnder 54 Kg: 1000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 800 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r54 Kg to 91 Kg: 1500 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1200 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\rOver 91 Kg: 2000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1600 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day.\r750/600 mg tablet: 1 tablet two times daily or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere have been no reports of significant drug interactions of Glucosamine and Chondroitin with Antibiotics/ Antidepressants/ Antihypertensives/ Nitrates/ Antiarrythmics/ Anxiolytics/ Hypoglycemic agents/ Antisecretives/ Antiasthmatics. Chondroitin may enhance the blood thinning effects of anticoagulants like Warfarin, Heparin.\rContraindications\rThere are no known contraindications for Glucosamine and Chondroitin. But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\rSide Effects\rSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate. Glucosamine and Chondroitin has not been studied enough to determine their effects on a developing fetus. No studies have evaluated the use of Glucosamine and Chondroitin during pregnancy or lactation. It should be taken with caution and medical advice during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with Diabetes Mellitus are advised to monitor blood glucose levels regularly when taking Glucosamine. No special studies were formed in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. The toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile of Glucosamine and Chondroitin does not indicate limitations for these patients. However, administration to patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency should be under appropriate medical supervision. Children should not be supplemented with Glucosamine and Chondroitin.\rTherapeutic Class\rStimulation of Cartilage formation\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\r\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement. It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\r\nPharmacology\r\nGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r\n \nChondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r\n \nCombining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\r\nDosage & Administration\r\n250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience. Typical dosage recommendation, based on body weight is as follows-\r\nUnder 54 Kg: 1000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 800 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r\n54 Kg to 91 Kg: 1500 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1200 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r\nOver 91 Kg: 2000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1600 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day.\r\n750/600 mg tablet: 1 tablet two times daily or as directed by the physician.\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nThere have been no reports of significant drug interactions of Glucosamine and Chondroitin with Antibiotics/ Antidepressants/ Antihypertensives/ Nitrates/ Antiarrythmics/ Anxiolytics/ Hypoglycemic agents/ Antisecretives/ Antiasthmatics. Chondroitin may enhance the blood thinning effects of anticoagulants like Warfarin, Heparin.\r\nContraindications\r\nThere are no known contraindications for Glucosamine and Chondroitin. But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate. Glucosamine and Chondroitin has not been studied enough to determine their effects on a developing fetus. No studies have evaluated the use of Glucosamine and Chondroitin during pregnancy or lactation. It should be taken with caution and medical advice during pregnancy and lactation.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPatients with Diabetes Mellitus are advised to monitor blood glucose levels regularly when taking Glucosamine. No special studies were formed in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. The toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile of Glucosamine and Chondroitin does not indicate limitations for these patients. However, administration to patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency should be under appropriate medical supervision.

        "description": "Indications\rVitamin D3 deficiency can occur in people whose exposure to sunlight is limited and in those whose diet is deficient in vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\rDosage & Administration\rFor capsule: Adults:\rTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day. To confirm the target level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, measurement of it should be determined 3-4 months after initiating the maintenance therapy.\rPrevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 4 weeks. Higher doses may be required in certain situations.\rAddition to specific therapy for osteoporosis: 20000 IU once a month.\rFor capsule: Children (12-18 years):\rTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks.\rPrevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 6 weeks.\rFor film-coated tablet: 1000 IU (1-2 tablets) daily, or as directed by physician. Take the medicine with food or within 1 hour after a meal.\r For oroflash or chewable tablets: 1000 IU to 2000 IU daily, or as directed by physician.

Following oral\radministration tibolone is rapidly metabolized into three compounds, which contribute to the pharmacological effects of tibolone.\rTwo of these metabolites (3 alpha-hydroxide-tibolone and 3 beta-hydroxide-tibolone) have predominantly estrogenic activity, a\rthird metabolite (delta 4-isomer of tibolone) and the parent compound have progestogenic and androgenic activities.\r  INDICATIONS\r Ubilon is indicated for the following conditions:\r * Treatment of the climacteric symptoms [hot flushes, sweating, vaginal dryness & less elasticity, mood disorders, anxiety etc.]\rresulting from the natural or artificial menopause.\r * Prevention of postmenopausal and post oophorectomy osteoporosis and improvement of bone-mineral density in patients with\restablished post-menopausal osteoporosis.\r * Vaginal atrophy.\r * Prevention of frequent UTI and urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Climacteric symptoms & other post-menopausal problems in adults and elderly women: The dosage is 2.5 mg tablet per day, preferably\rat the same time of the day. Symptomatic relief occurs within few days, but optimal results are obtained minimum after 3 months.\r Osteoporosis: To prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women or after oophorectomy an uninterrupted longer (5-10 years) therapy\rof 2.5 mg daily is needed.\r Starting Ubilon:\rIn case of natural menopause: To avoid irregular & abnormal bleeding, ubilon should be started at least 12 months after last\rnatural bleeding.\r In case of artificial menopause : Treatment should be started immediately.\r In case of switching over from other conventional HRT:\rIf someone switches from estrogen-only preparation, she should start after a withdrawal bleeding.\rIf someone switches from sequential HRT preparation she should wait for the completion of the progestogen phase.\rIf someone switches from continuous combined HRT, she can start any time.\r In case of missed pill: If no more than 12 hours have passed, the pill should be taken immediately. Otherwise the next dose should\rbe continued as before.\r  SIDE EFFECTS\r Generally tibolone is well tolerated. However, a few adverse reactions have been observed like headache, pre-tibial oedema, change\rin body mass, dizziness, rash and abdominal pain. Vaginal bleeding may occur mainly during the first 1-3 months of treatment.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Renal dysfunction.\rEpilepsy or migraine.\rImpaired carbohydrate metabolism.\rHypercholesterolemia.\rLiver diseases.\rWith anticoagulants.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Tibolone is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation.\r  DRUG INTERACTION\r Since tibolone may increase blood fibrinolytic activity, it may enhance the effect of anticoagulants. This effect has been\rreported with warfarin.\rDrugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes or other enzyme inducing drugs may accelerate the metabolism of tibolone and thus\rlower its activity.\r  OVER DOSE\r The acute toxicity of tibolone in animals is very low. Therefore, toxic symptoms are not expected to occur, even when several\rtablets are taken simultaneously. In case of acute overdose nausea, vomiting, withdrawal bleeding etc. may occur.

Vitamin D3 is essential for the effective calcium and phosphate absorption required for healthy bones and teeth,preventing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 is also essential to prevent pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and breast feeding as it is an essential nutrient for a growing infant. Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\rMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\rPharmacology\rThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium.

Vitamin A is highly important for vision, cell development and immunity. Vitamin A's role on immunity contributes to its anti-cancer properties.\r Vitamin C is one of the most widely taken supplements and plays a primary role in the formation of collagen, which is important for the growth and repair of cells, gums, blood vessels, bones and teeth. Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.\r Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.\r Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.\r Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.\r Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.\r Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems.\r Manganese, an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). SOD is an enzyme that protect against cell damaging free radicals.\rDosage & Administration\rThe adult dose is 1 (one) tablet daily, or as prescribed by the physician.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rContraindications\rThis product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.\rSide Effects\rGenerally, Evagren is well-tolerated.

Vitamin A is highly important for vision, cell development and immunity. Vitamin A's role on immunity contributes to its anti-cancer properties.\r\n \nVitamin C is one of the most widely taken supplements and plays a primary role in the formation of collagen, which is important for the growth and repair of cells, gums, blood vessels, bones and teeth. Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant.\r\n \nVitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium.\r\n \nVitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis.\r\n \nZinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body.\r\n \nSelenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities.\r\n \nCopper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems.\r\n \nManganese, an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). SOD is an enzyme that protect against cell damaging free radicals.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nThe adult dose is 1 (one) tablet daily, or as prescribed by the physician.\r\n* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nContraindications\r\nThis product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nGenerally, Evagren is well-tolerated.

Colecalciferol\r(vitamin D3) is a secosterol that is the natural precursor of the Calcium-regulating hormone Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin\rD3).\r  INDICATIONS\r Bonemass D is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to increase bonemass in men with\rosteoporosis. Bonemass D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency.\r  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: One tablet once weekly.\r Treatment to increase bonemass in men with osteoporosis: One tablet once weekly.\r Dosing in elderly and renal insufficiency: No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with mild-to-moderate\rrenal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min). Bonemass D is not recommended for patients with more severe renal\rinsufficiency (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min) due to lack of experience.\r Bonemass D must be taken at least one to half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water\ronly. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of Alendronate. To\rfacilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Bonemass D should only be swallowed\rupon arising for the day with a full glass of water and patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their\rfirst food of the day. Bonemass D should not be taken at bedtime.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r The most common side-effect is digestive reactions from Bonemass D. These reactions include irritation, inflammation, or ulcers of\rthe esophagus, which may sometimes bleed. This may occur especially if patients do not drink a full glass of water with Bonemass D\ror if they lie down in less than 30 minutes or before their first food of the day. Less common side-effects are nausea, vomiting,\ra full or bloated feeling in the stomach, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, gas, headache, a changed sense of taste,\rand bone, muscle, or joint pain.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r Alendronate Sodium: Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with Bonemass D. Other disorders affecting mineral\rmetabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and\rsymptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with Bonemass D.\r Colecalciferol: Bonemass D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D\rinsufficiency (e.g. those who are nursing home bound, chronically ill, over the age of 70 years) should receive vitamin D\rsupplementation in addition to that provided in Bonemass D.\r  USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r There is no studies in pregnant women. Bonemass D should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the\rpotential risk to the mother and fetus. Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk. It is not known\rwhether Alendronate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when\rBonemass D is administered to nursing women. Bonemass D is not indicated for use in children.\r  OVER DOSE\r Alendronate Sodium: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Alendronate. Hypocalcemia,\rhypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer,\rmay result from oral overdosage. Milk or Antacids should be given to bind Alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation,\rvomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.\r Colecalciferol: There is limited information regarding overdosage of Colecalciferol associated with acute toxicity. Signs and\rsymptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weakness,\rand lethargy. Serum and urine calcium levels should be monitored in patients with suspected vitamin D toxicity. Standard therapy\rincludes restriction of dietary calcium, hydration, and systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe hypercalcemia.\r  STORAGE\r Bonemass D tablet should be stored at 20-25 °C. Protect from moisture and light.\r  COMMERCIAL PACK\r Bonemass D: Each box contains 1 blister strip of 10 tablets.\nPRESENTATION\r\n \nBonemass D: Each tablet contains Alendronate monosodium trihydrate USP equivalent to 70 mg of Alendronic acid, and Colecalciferol\r\nBP 70 mcg equivalent to 2800 International Units (IUs).\r\n \n \nDESCRIPTION\r\n \nAlendronate Sodium is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

Bonemass D is not recommended for patients with more severe renal\r\ninsufficiency (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min) due to lack of experience.\r\n \nBonemass D must be taken at least one to half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water\r\nonly. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of Alendronate. To\r\nfacilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Bonemass D should only be swallowed\r\nupon arising for the day with a full glass of water and patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their\r\nfirst food of the day. Bonemass D should not be taken at bedtime.\r\n \n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nThe most common side-effect is digestive reactions from Bonemass D. These reactions include irritation, inflammation, or ulcers of\r\nthe esophagus, which may sometimes bleed. This may occur especially if patients do not drink a full glass of water with Bonemass D\r\nor if they lie down in less than 30 minutes or before their first food of the day. Less common side-effects are nausea, vomiting,\r\na full or bloated feeling in the stomach, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, gas, headache, a changed sense of taste,\r\nand bone, muscle, or joint pain.\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nAlendronate Sodium: Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with Bonemass D. Other disorders affecting mineral\r\nmetabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and\r\nsymptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with Bonemass D.\r\n \nColecalciferol: Bonemass D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D\r\ninsufficiency (e.g. those who are nursing home bound, chronically ill, over the age of 70 years) should receive vitamin D\r\nsupplementation in addition to that provided in Bonemass D.\r\n \n \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r\n \nThere is no studies in pregnant women. Bonemass D should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the\r\npotential risk to the mother and fetus. Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk. It is not known\r\nwhether Alendronate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when\r\nBonemass D is administered to nursing women. Bonemass D is not indicated for use in children.\r\n \n \nOVER DOSE\r\n \nAlendronate Sodium: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Alendronate. Hypocalcemia,\r\nhypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer,\r\nmay result from oral overdosage. Milk or Antacids should be given to bind Alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation,\r\nvomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.\r\n \nColecalciferol: There is limited information regarding overdosage of Colecalciferol associated with acute toxicity. Signs and\r\nsymptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weakness,\r\nand lethargy. Serum and urine calcium levels should be monitored in patients with suspected vitamin D toxicity. Standard therapy\r\nincludes restriction of dietary calcium, hydration, and systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe hypercalcemia.\r\n \n \nSTORAGE\r\n \nBonemass D tablet should be stored at 20-25 °C. Protect from moisture and light.\r\n \n \nCOMMERCIAL PACK\r\n \nBonemass D: Each box contains 1 blister strip of 10 tablets.",

        "description": "Indications\rBone-Guard is indicated for the:\rTreatment of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\rPrevention of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\rPrevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men\rTreatment of Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis may be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass (T-score <-2.0 SD) and the presence or history of osteoporotic fracture, or a low bone mass (T-score <-2.5 SD) in the absence of documented pre-existing osteoporotic fracture.\rPharmacology\rThe pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumors or tumor extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. The high potency and therapeutic margin of ibandronic acid allows for more flexible dosing regimens and intermittent treatment with long drug-free intervals at comparatively low doses.\r Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity, It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone. Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels, leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass. Daily or intermittent administration of ibandronic acid results in reduced bone resorption as reflected in reduced levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover, increased BMD and a decreased incidence of fractures.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Ibandronic acid for treatment is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably be taken on the same date each month. Ibandronic acid should be taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or any other oral medication or supplementation (including calcium):\rTablets should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is sitting or standing in an upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic acid.\rPlain water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic acid. Please note that some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore should not be used.\rPatients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. Patients should receive supplemental calcium or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. In case a once-monthly dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet the morning after the tablet is remembered unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days. Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled. Patients should not take two 150 mg tablets within the same week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIt is likely that calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Bone-Guard. Therefore, patients must wait 60 minutes after taking Bone-Guard before taking other oral medications. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (estrogen). No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma. In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, i.v. ranitidine caused an increase in Bone-Guard bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal range of the bioavailability of Bone-Guard, no dosage adjustment is required when Bone-Guard is administered with H2-antagonists or other drugs which increase gastric pH.\r In relation to disposition, no drug interactions of clinical significance are considered likely, since Bone-Guard does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. Furthermore, plasma protein binding is low at therapeutic concentrations and Bone-Guard is therefore unlikely to displace other drugs. Bone-Guard is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs. In a one-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16549). the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking Bone-Guard 2.5 mg daily or 150mg once monthly. Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of Bone-Guard, 14% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in the patients treated with Bone-Guard 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with Bone-Guard 2.5 mg daily.\rContraindications\rIbandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected hypocalcemia. As with all bisphosphonates indicated in the treatment of osteoporosis, pre-existing hypocalcemia needs to be corrected before initiating therapy with Ibandronic Acid. As with several bisphosphonates, Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients who are unable to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes.\rSide Effects\rThe main side effects of Bone-Guard are dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during pregnancy. There was no evidence for a direct fetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in daily orally treated rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). Specific studies for the monthly regimen have not been performed. There is no clinical experience with Ibandronic Acid in pregnant women.\r Nursing Mothers: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during lactation. In lactating rats treated with 0.08 mg/kg/day IV. ibandronic acid, the highest concentration of ibandronic acid in breast milk was 8.1 ng/ml and was seen in the first 2 hours after i.v. administration. After 24 hours, the concentration in milk and plasma was similar, and corresponded to about 5 % of the concentration measured after 2 hours.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting Bone-Guard therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. Orally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Bone-Guard is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, in some cases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply with the dosing instructions.\r Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue Bone-Guard and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. While no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications. Since NSAIDs and bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant medication with Bone-Guard. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment.\rUse in Special Populations\rPatients with renal impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine clearance is ≥30 ml/min. Below 30 ml/min creatinine clearance, the decision to administer Bone-Guard should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment.\r Patients with hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary.\r Elderly: No dosage adjustment is necessary.\r Children: Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients less than 18 years old.\rOverdose Effects\rNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bone-Guard. However, oral overdosage may result in upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Bone-Guard. Owing to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.\rTherapeutic Class\rBisphosphonate preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

They play an important role in ensuring healthy brain and nerve function, healthy red blood cells formation in children & adults. They are specially needed for healthy growth and development of children. B-Vitamin deficiencies in adult cause profound fatigue and various types of neurologic manifestations, which may include weakness, poor balance, confusion, irritability, memory loss, nervousness, tingling of the limbs and loss of coordination.

The suspension work in two ways-\rNeutralizing excess stomach acid to relieve the pain & discomfort\rForming a protective barrier over the stomach contents to soothe the burning pain in your chest.\rThe mode of action of the product is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. The product is a combination of two antacids (Calcium Carbonate and Sodium Bicarbonate) and an Alginate. On ingestion, the medicinal product reacts rapidly with gastric acid to form a raft of Alginic Acid gel having a near neutral pH and studies have shown that the raft interacts with and caps the acid pocket in the stomach, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The raft floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-esophageal reflux, for up to 4 hours, and protecting the esophagus from Acid, Pepsin and Bile.In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the esophagus, in preference to the stomach contents, and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within it structure, further protecting the esophagus from these gastric components. Calcium Carbonate neutralizes gastric acid to provide fast relief from indigestion and heartburn.This effect is increased by the addition of Sodium Bicarbonate which also has a neutralizing action.\rGaviraft - MedEx campaign banner\rDosage & Administration\rFor oral suspension:\rAdult and children over 12 years:10-20 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren 6 to 12 years: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 6 years: Not recommended.\rElderly: No dose modifications necessary.\rChewable Tablet should be taken in oral route after being thoroughly chewed. Recommended dose:\rAdults and children 12 years and over: Take two to four tablets after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.\rChildren under 12 years: Tablets should be given only on medical advice.\r Hepatic Impairment: No dose modification necessary.\rRenal Insufficiency: Caution if highly restricted salt diet is necessary.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rA time-interval of 2 hours should be considered between Algicid Plus intake and the administration of other medicinal products, especially Tetracyclines, Digoxine, Fluoroquinolone, Iron salt, Ketoconazole, Neuroleptics, Thyroid Hormones, Penicillamine, beta-blockers (Atenolol, Metoprolol, Propranolol), Glucocorticoid, Chloroquine and Biphosphonates (diphosphonates) and Estramustine.\rContraindications\rThis product is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or to any of the excipients.\rSide Effects\rIn addition to the desired effect of the drug, some side effects may appear such as: constipation, flatulence, stomach cramp or belching. In these cases consult a physician. If too big dose has been taken, there might appear a sensation of swelling. In this case, it is advisable to consult a physician.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Clinical studies in more than 500 pregnant women, as well as a large amount of data from post-marketing experience, indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of the active ingredients. This drug can be used during pregnancy, if clinically needed.\r Breastfeeding: No effects of the active substances have been shown in breastfed newborns/infants of treated mothers. This drug can be used during breastfeeding.\r Fertility: Pre-clinical investigations have revealed Alginate has no negative effect on parental or offspring fertility or reproduction. Clinical data do not suggest that this drug has an effect on human fertility.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rEach 20 ml of dose has a sodium content of 254.5 mg (11.06 mmol). This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g. in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment.\r Each 20 ml contains 260 mg (6.5 mmol) of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis, and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi.\r Treatment of children younger than 12 years of age is not generally recommended, except on medical advice.\r Algicid Plus is considered high in sodium. This should be taken into account when a highly restricted salt diet is recommended, e.g., in some cases of congestive cardiac failure and renal impairment. Each tablet contains 75 mg of calcium. Care needs to be taken in treating patients with hypercalcaemia, nephrocalcinosis and recurrent calcium containing renal calculi. Due to its aspartame content Algicid Plus should not be given to patients with phenylketonuria. If symptoms persist, or treatment is required for more than 7 days continuously, medical advice should be sought. Taking Algicid Plus can mask the symptoms of other more serious, underlying medical conditions. It should not be used in patients with impaired renal function/insufficiency and with hypophosphatemia. This may cause allergic reactions.\rOverdose Effects\rIn the event of over dosage symptomatic treatment should be given.

It does not interact with the food components and other medications and so there is no decrease in bioavailability of Iron Polymaltose Complex. This makes sure that with the consumption of this complex, iron gets utilized at a faster rate in the haemoglobin synthesis. Folic acid prevents neural tube defects. Zinc is essential for many metabolic processes, blood formation, wound healing and for immune system. Thiamine is essential for the functioning of the nervous and digestive systems. Riboflavin is important for digestion, immune system support and energy production. Pyridoxin is important for brain development, production of red blood cells, metabolism of proteins and to reduce morning sickness. Nicotinamide is important for energy, blood pressure and circulation.\rDosage & Administration\rOne capsule daily. In more severe cases, 2 capsules a day may be required or as directed by the physician.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rNo drug interactions have been reported.\rContraindications\rThis product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.\rSide Effects\rGenerally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rRecommended during pregnancy & lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rCare should be taken in patients who may develop iron overloads, such as those with haemochromatosis, haemolytic anaemia or red cell aplasia. Iron chelates with tetracycline and absorption may be impaired.\rOverdose Effects\rAccidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children below 6 years. Avoid higher doses if you have liver disease or hemochromatosis; excess can cause bloody diarrhea, vomiting, acidosis, darkened stools, abdominal pain. Symptoms may clear in a few hours. Riboflavin is reported to be completely safe and no toxic symptoms have been reported so far. Higher doses of Nicotinamide may cause vomiting, diarrhea. Sensory neuropathy was observed in individuals consuming more than 200 mg Pyridoxine for very long periods. No case of Folic acid overdose has been reported. Zinc toxicity has been seen in both acute and chronic forms. Ingestion of 150 to 450 mg of zinc per day has been associated with low copper status, altered iron function, reduced immune function, and reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins. So, Zinc at its RDA dosage does not cause any significant effect.\rTherapeutic Class\rIron & Vitamin Combined preparations\rStorage Conditions\rDo not store above 30°C.

        "description": "Indications\rBondrova is indicated for the:\rTreatment of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\rPrevention of osteoporosis in women (specially postmenopausal)\rPrevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men\rTreatment of Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis may be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass (T-score <-2.0 SD) and the presence or history of osteoporotic fracture, or a low bone mass (T-score <-2.5 SD) in the absence of documented pre-existing osteoporotic fracture.\rPharmacology\rThe pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumors or tumor extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased bone mass compared with untreated animals. Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. The high potency and therapeutic margin of ibandronic acid allows for more flexible dosing regimens and intermittent treatment with long drug-free intervals at comparatively low doses.\r Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity, It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone. Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels, leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass. Daily or intermittent administration of ibandronic acid results in reduced bone resorption as reflected in reduced levels of serum and urinary biochemical markers of bone turnover, increased BMD and a decreased incidence of fractures.\rDosage & Administration\rThe recommended dose of Ibandronic acid for treatment is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably be taken on the same date each month. Ibandronic acid should be taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or any other oral medication or supplementation (including calcium):\rTablets should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is sitting or standing in an upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic acid.\rPlain water is the only drink that should be taken with Ibandronic acid. Please note that some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore should not be used.\rPatients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. Patients should receive supplemental calcium or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. In case a once-monthly dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet the morning after the tablet is remembered unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days. Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled. Patients should not take two 150 mg tablets within the same week.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rIt is likely that calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Bondrova. Therefore, patients must wait 60 minutes after taking Bondrova before taking other oral medications. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (estrogen). No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma. In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, i.v. ranitidine caused an increase in Bondrova bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal range of the bioavailability of Bondrova, no dosage adjustment is required when Bondrova is administered with H2-antagonists or other drugs which increase gastric pH.\r In relation to disposition, no drug interactions of clinical significance are considered likely, since Bondrova does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. Furthermore, plasma protein binding is low at therapeutic concentrations and Bondrova is therefore unlikely to displace other drugs. Bondrova is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs. In a one-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16549). the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking Bondrova 2.5 mg daily or 150mg once monthly. Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of Bondrova, 14% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in the patients treated with Bondrova 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with Bondrova 2.5 mg daily.\rContraindications\rIbandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected hypocalcemia. As with all bisphosphonates indicated in the treatment of osteoporosis, pre-existing hypocalcemia needs to be corrected before initiating therapy with Ibandronic Acid. As with several bisphosphonates, Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients with abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia. Ibandronic Acid is contraindicated in patients who are unable to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes.\rSide Effects\rThe main side effects of Bondrova are dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rPregnancy: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during pregnancy. There was no evidence for a direct fetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in daily orally treated rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome). Specific studies for the monthly regimen have not been performed. There is no clinical experience with Ibandronic Acid in pregnant women.\r Nursing Mothers: Ibandronic Acid should not be used during lactation. In lactating rats treated with 0.08 mg/kg/day IV. ibandronic acid, the highest concentration of ibandronic acid in breast milk was 8.1 ng/ml and was seen in the first 2 hours after i.v. administration. After 24 hours, the concentration in milk and plasma was similar, and corresponded to about 5 % of the concentration measured after 2 hours.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rHypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting Bondrova therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. Orally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when Bondrova is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (e.g. known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, in some cases severe and requiring hospitalization, rarely with bleeding or followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention and be able to comply with the dosing instructions.\r Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue Bondrova and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. While no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications. Since NSAIDs and bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant medication with Bondrova. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment.\rUse in Special Populations\rPatients with renal impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine clearance is ≥30 ml/min. Below 30 ml/min creatinine clearance, the decision to administer Bondrova should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment.\r Patients with hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary.\r Elderly: No dosage adjustment is necessary.\r Children: Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients less than 18 years old.\rOverdose Effects\rNo specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bondrova. However, oral overdosage may result in upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Bondrova. Owing to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.\rTherapeutic Class\rBisphosphonate preparations\rStorage Conditions\rKeep below 30°C temperature, away from light & moisture.

        "description": "Indications\rThis Kit is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in women (especially after menopause) & men. It increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures.\rDescription\rIbandronic Acid is a group of medicine called bisphosphonates. It alters the cycle of bone formation and break down in the body. It slows bone loss while increasing bones mass, which may prevent bone fracture. Ibandronic Acid has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as a hydroxyapatite agent. At the cellular level, Ibandronic Acid inhibits osteoclast. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but show evidence of reduce active resorption.\r Osteoporosis: Human body constantly breaking down old bone and making new bone tissue. If people have osteoporosis, their body breaks down more bones than it forms. So that gradually bone loss occurs and bones become thinner and fragile. This is especially common in women after the menopause. Many people with osteoporosis have no symptom and may not even know that they have it. However, osteoporosis makes them more likely to have fractures, especially in spine, hips and wrists.\rDosage & Administration\rOne tablet of Ibandronic Acid 150 mg once monthly of the same date of each month is recommended. To maximize the clinical benefit of Ibandronic Acid, two tablets of Calcium Orotate per day are usually recommended in divided dosage.\r To maximize absorption and clinical benefit, Ibandronic Acid tablet of this Kit should be taken at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins.\r To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Ibandronic Acid tablet should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (250 ml) while the patient is standing or sitting in an upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic Acid tablet.\r Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet of this Kit should be taken on the same date of each month (i.e., the patients Ibandronic Acid day)\r If the once monthly dose is missed, and the patients next scheduled Ibandronic Acid day is more than 7 days away, the patient should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered. The patient should then return to taking one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day, according to their original schedule.\r If the once monthly dose is missed, and the patients next scheduled Ibandronic Acid day is only 1 to 7 days away, the patient must wait until the subsequent month’s scheduled Ibandronic Acid day to take their tablet.

It increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures.\r\nDescription\r\nIbandronic Acid is a group of medicine called bisphosphonates. It alters the cycle of bone formation and break down in the body. It slows bone loss while increasing bones mass, which may prevent bone fracture. Ibandronic Acid has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as a hydroxyapatite agent. At the cellular level, Ibandronic Acid inhibits osteoclast. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but show evidence of reduce active resorption.\r\n \nOsteoporosis: Human body constantly breaking down old bone and making new bone tissue. If people have osteoporosis, their body breaks down more bones than it forms. So that gradually bone loss occurs and bones become thinner and fragile. This is especially common in women after the menopause. Many people with osteoporosis have no symptom and may not even know that they have it. However, osteoporosis makes them more likely to have fractures, especially in spine, hips and wrists.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOne tablet of Ibandronic Acid 150 mg once monthly of the same date of each month is recommended. To maximize the clinical benefit of Ibandronic Acid, two tablets of Calcium Orotate per day are usually recommended in divided dosage.\r\n \nTo maximize absorption and clinical benefit, Ibandronic Acid tablet of this Kit should be taken at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins.\r\n \nTo facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, Ibandronic Acid tablet should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (250 ml) while the patient is standing or sitting in an upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking Ibandronic Acid tablet.\r\n \nIbandronic Acid 150 mg tablet of this Kit should be taken on the same date of each month (i.e., the patients Ibandronic Acid day)\r\n \nIf the once monthly dose is missed, and the patients next scheduled Ibandronic Acid day is more than 7 days away, the patient should be instructed to take one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered. The patient should then return to taking one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day, according to their original schedule.\r\n \nIf the once monthly dose is missed, and the patients next scheduled Ibandronic Acid day is only 1 to 7 days away, the patient must wait until the subsequent month’s scheduled Ibandronic Acid day to take their tablet. The patient should then return to taking one Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day according to their original schedule.\r\n \nThe Patient must not take two Ibandronic Acid 150 mg tablets within the same week.\r\n \nStart taking Calcium Orotate tablets from the next day of Ibandronic Acid day (from day-2 and onwards).\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nIbandronic Acid: Products containing calcium and other multivalent cautions (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of Ibandronic Acid.

Clinical and animaldata indicates that this caretenoid could protect the macula from oxidative or light damage.\r\n \nAlthough exact mechanism of action is not clear but onelarge study has found that high levels of dietary Lutein is associated with relatively lower risk of AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration). Zinc is an essential trace element involved in many enzymes system.\r\n \nSymptoms of less severe deficiency include distorted or absent perception of taste, smell and poor wound healing. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhea, increased susceptibility to infection and failure to thrive in children.\r\n \nCopper plays important role in growth, skeletal integrity, and development of nervous system. As a part of various enzymes, it takes part in numerous metabolic conversions.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nOne capsule, one or two times daily or as directed by the physician\r\n* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\r\nInteraction\r\nNo drug interaction has been reported.\r\nContraindications\r\nIt is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.\r\nSide Effects\r\nLarge doses of Vitamin C are reported to cause diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disturbances.

Also, Corticosteroids, such as Prednisolone increase the need for Vitamin D3.\rContraindications\rVitamin D3 is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D3 (or medicines of the same class) and any of the excipients. It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.\rSide Effects\rSymptoms rarely include anorexia, lassitude, nausea & vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, polyuria, sweating, headache, thirst, vertigo, and raised concentrations of calcium and phosphate in plasma and urine.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rStudies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy.

Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor capsule: Adults:\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks. Doses for maintenance therapy is 1400-2000 IU/day. To confirm the target level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D, measurement of it should be determined 3-4 months after initiating the maintenance therapy.\r\nPrevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 4 weeks. Higher doses may be required in certain situations.\r\nAddition to specific therapy for osteoporosis: 20000 IU once a month.\r\nFor capsule: Children (12-18 years):\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks.\r\nPrevention of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 20000 IU every 6 weeks.\r\nFor film-coated tablet: 1000 IU (1-2 tablets) daily, or as directed by physician.

Vitamin D3 has vital role on immunity boost up.\r\nMeningitis - MedEx campaign banner\r\nPharmacology\r\nThe active form of Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, exerts its effect by binding to the Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are widely distributed through many body tissues.Vitamin D3 has a half life of about 50 days as it is fat soluble.Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to specific a-globulins and transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcidiol). A second hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (Calcitriol) occurs in the kidney. This metabolite is responsible for the vitamin's ability to increase the absorption of calcium. Non-metabolised Vitamin D3 is stored in tissues such as fat and muscle.Vitamin D3 is eliminated via faeces and urine.\r\nDosage & Administration\r\nFor capsule: Adults:\r\nTreatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency: 40000 IU once weekly for 7 weeks.

It is also beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis, sport injuries, migraine, different skin problems (e.g., psoriasis), vascular complications (e. g., atherosclerosis), kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, leaky gut syndrome).\rPharmacology\rGlucosamine is a natural amino-sugar, produced by the body and found in certain foods. It is the most fundamental building block required for biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like Hyaluronic Acid, Keratan Sulfate, and Chondroitin Sulfate. GAGs binds with protein and form proteoglycans, the essential building block of articular cartilage. When cartilage in a joint deteriorates,Osteoarthritis develops. It also helps to form ligaments, tendon, nails, and various other connective tissues.When we take artificially synthesized Glucosamine Sulfate supplement, it increases Glucosamine level in the body, thus facilitates production and repair of cartilage. Glucosamine also activates chondrocytes in the cartilage which help produce GAGs and proteoglycans.\r Chondroitin Sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (acid muco polysaccharide) found in connective tissue, especially in the articular cartilage of all mammals. Chondroitin Sulfate supplement acts similarly as Glucosamine Sulfate, since it also provide substrate for proteoglycans. Chondroitin also protects existing healthy cartilage from premature decline by preventing the MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase) enzyme that breakdowns the proteoglycans.\r Combining Glucosamine with Chondroitin Sulfate shows synergistic effect. Data supports that this combination has been shown to be very much effective in severe cases of Osteoarthritis that treats both sign and symptoms of Osteoarthritis & modifies disease progression. It prevents Osteoarthritis in case of normal adults. In Osteoarthritic pain it is as effective as NSAIDs with significantly better tolerability and clinical compliance. It is also helpful during the repair phase of musculo-skeletal soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament strains\rDosage & Administration\r250/200 mg tablet: 1 to 2 tablets, three times daily. Dose may be adjusted according to the response of the drug and body weight. Doses can be tapered after 60 days as per requirement of the individual and for cost convenience. Typical dosage recommendation, based on body weight is as follows-\rUnder 54 Kg: 1000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 800 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\r54 Kg to 91 Kg: 1500 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1200 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day\rOver 91 Kg: 2000 mg Glucosamine Sulfate & 1600 mg Chondroitin Sulfate per day.\r750/600 mg tablet: 1 tablet two times daily or as directed by the physician.\r* চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rInteraction\rThere have been no reports of significant drug interactions of Glucosamine and Chondroitin with Antibiotics/ Antidepressants/ Antihypertensives/ Nitrates/ Antiarrythmics/ Anxiolytics/ Hypoglycemic agents/ Antisecretives/ Antiasthmatics. Chondroitin may enhance the blood thinning effects of anticoagulants like Warfarin, Heparin.\rContraindications\rThere are no known contraindications for Glucosamine and Chondroitin. But proven hypersensitivity (e. g. allergic to shellfish or sulfur) to Glucosamine and Chondroitin is a contraindication.\rSide Effects\rSafety studies with Glucosamine Sulfate & Chondroitin Sulfate show no demonstrable side effects. Rarely occurring side effects (such as, mild & reversible intestinal flatulence) are almost like placebo.\rPregnancy & Lactation\rWomen who are pregnant or who could become pregnant should not supplement with Glucosamine Sulfate or Chondroitin Sulfate. Glucosamine and Chondroitin has not been studied enough to determine their effects on a developing fetus. No studies have evaluated the use of Glucosamine and Chondroitin during pregnancy or lactation. It should be taken with caution and medical advice during pregnancy and lactation.\rPrecautions & Warnings\rPatients with Diabetes Mellitus are advised to monitor blood glucose levels regularly when taking Glucosamine. No special studies were formed in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. The toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile of Glucosamine and Chondroitin does not indicate limitations for these patients. However, administration to patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency should be under appropriate medical supervision. Children should not be supplemented with Glucosamine and Chondroitin.\rTherapeutic Class\rStimulation of Cartilage formation\rStorage Conditions\rStore in a cool and dry place, protected from light.\nIndications\r\nIndicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee, hip, spine, hand, and other locations as a dietary supplement.

It is contraindicated if there is evidence of Vitamin D3 toxicity.\r\nSide Effects\r\nSymptoms rarely include anorexia, lassitude, nausea & vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, polyuria, sweating, headache, thirst, vertigo, and raised concentrations of calcium and phosphate in plasma and urine.\r\nPregnancy & Lactation\r\nStudies have shown safe use of doses up to 4000 IU during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 400 IU, however, in women who are considered to be Vitamin D3 deficient a higher dose may be required. During pregnancy women should follow the advice of their medical practitioner as their requirements may vary depending on the severity of their disease and their response to treatment\r\n \nVitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk. Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nPlasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.\r\nUse in Special Populations\r\nThe safety & efficacy of Vitamin D3 in children under 12 years have not been established.\r\nOverdose Effects\r\nIt can lead to hypervitaminosis D.\r\nTherapeutic Class\r\nVitamin in bone formation, Vitamin-D preparations\r\nStorage Conditions\r\nKeep below 30º C temperature, protected from light & moisture.

Potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. It participates in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle and the maintenance of normal renal function.\rDosage & Administration\rOral dose: It should be taken with or after meals with plenty of fluid (water/fruit juice). Typical doses for the prevention of hypokalaemia may be upto 50 mmol (about 37.5 mL) daily by mouth. Oral treatment may be suitable in some cases of hypokalaemia and similar doses to those used for prevention may be adequate in mild potassium deficiency. However, higher doses may be needed in more severe deficiency.\r Parenteral dose: Intravenous administration may be required in acute hypokalaemia. One ampoule (10 mL) i.e. 1.5 gm (20 mmol k+) may be added to 500 mL of sodium chloride or glucose intravenous infusion and given slowly over 2 to 3 hours with specialist advice and ECG monitoring in difficult cases.

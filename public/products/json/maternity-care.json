Pregcare contains L-arginie, Proanthocyanidin, Folic Acid, Zinc.

Folic Acid protects against fetal structural anomalies, including Neural Tube defects, preterm birth and congenital heart defects. Zinc is an essential component for embryogenesis, fetal growth and development and mammary gland function for milk synthesis and secretion. Pregcare significantly decreases blood pressure in pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) & pre-eclampsia, helps to improve amniotic fluid within 1-4 weeks, improves fetal growth & increases birth weight in IUGR.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial active against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram-negative\rocular pathogens. It is available as the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of\r1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)- 3-quinoline-carboxylic acid. It is a faint to light yellow crystalline\rpowder with a molecular weight of 385.8. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3.HCl.H2O.\r  INDICATIONS\r Beuflox eye/ear Solution is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated\rmicroorganisms in the conditions listed below:\r   Eye\r Corneal Ulcers:\r • Pseudomonas aeruginosa\r • Serratia marcescens\r • Staphylococcus aureus\r • Staphylococcus epidermidis\r • Streptococcus pneumonia\r • Streptococcus (Viridans Group)\r   Conjunctivitis:\r • Haemophilus influenza\r • Staphylococcus aureus\r • Staphylococcus epidermidis\r • Streptococcus pneumoniae\r   Ear\r Otitis externa, acute otitis media, cronic suppurative otitis media. Prophylaxis in otic surgeries such as mastoid surgery.\r    DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r Eye\rCorneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcers is 2 drops into the affected eye every 15\rminutes for the first 6 hours and then 2 drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the\rsecond day, instill 2 drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place 2 drops in the affected eye\revery four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.\rConjunctivitis: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is 1 or 2 drops instilled into the\rconjunctival sac(s) every 2 hours while awake for 2 days and one or 2 drops every 4 hours while awake for the next 5 days.\r Ear\rFor all infections, 2-3 drops every 2-3 hours initially, reducing the frequency of the instillation with control of infection.\rTreatment should be continued at least 7 days.\r   SIDE EFFECTS\r The most frequently reported drug related adverse reaction is local burning or discomfort. In corneal ulcer studies with frequent\radministration of the drug, white crystalline precipitates were seen in approximately 17% of patients. Other reactions occurring\rin less than 10% of patients included lid margin crusting, crystals/scales, foreign body sensation, itching, conjunctival\rhyperemia and a bad taste following instillation. Additional events occurring in less than 1% of patients included corneal\rstaining, keratopathy/keratitis, allergic reactions, lid edema, tearing, photophobia, corneal infiltrates, nausea and decreased\rvision.\r  PRECAUTIONS\r As with other antibacterial preparations, prolonged use of ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms,\rincluding fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.\rCiprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction.\r   USE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r Pregnancy Category C.

It is a faint to light yellow crystalline\r\npowder with a molecular weight of 385.8. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3.HCl.H2O.\r\n \n \nINDICATIONS\r\n \nBeuflox eye/ear Solution is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated\r\nmicroorganisms in the conditions listed below:\r\n \n \n \nEye\r\n \nCorneal Ulcers:\r\n \n• Pseudomonas aeruginosa\r\n \n• Serratia marcescens\r\n \n• Staphylococcus aureus\r\n \n• Staphylococcus epidermidis\r\n \n• Streptococcus pneumonia\r\n \n• Streptococcus (Viridans Group)\r\n \n \n \nConjunctivitis:\r\n \n• Haemophilus influenza\r\n \n• Staphylococcus aureus\r\n \n• Staphylococcus epidermidis\r\n \n• Streptococcus pneumoniae\r\n \n \n \nEar\r\n \nOtitis externa, acute otitis media, cronic suppurative otitis media. Prophylaxis in otic surgeries such as mastoid surgery.\r\n \n \n \n \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\r\n \nEye\r\nCorneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcers is 2 drops into the affected eye every 15\r\nminutes for the first 6 hours and then 2 drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the\r\nsecond day, instill 2 drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place 2 drops in the affected eye\r\nevery four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.\r\nConjunctivitis: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is 1 or 2 drops instilled into the\r\nconjunctival sac(s) every 2 hours while awake for 2 days and one or 2 drops every 4 hours while awake for the next 5 days.\r\n \nEar\r\nFor all infections, 2-3 drops every 2-3 hours initially, reducing the frequency of the instillation with control of infection.\r\nTreatment should be continued at least 7 days.\r\n \n \n \nSIDE EFFECTS\r\n \nThe most frequently reported drug related adverse reaction is local burning or discomfort. In corneal ulcer studies with frequent\r\nadministration of the drug, white crystalline precipitates were seen in approximately 17% of patients. Other reactions occurring\r\nin less than 10% of patients included lid margin crusting, crystals/scales, foreign body sensation, itching, conjunctival\r\nhyperemia and a bad taste following instillation. Additional events occurring in less than 1% of patients included corneal\r\nstaining, keratopathy/keratitis, allergic reactions, lid edema, tearing, photophobia, corneal infiltrates, nausea and decreased\r\nvision.\r\n \n \nPRECAUTIONS\r\n \nAs with other antibacterial preparations, prolonged use of ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms,\r\nincluding fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.\r\nCiprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction.\r\n \n \n \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\r\n \nPregnancy Category C.

It helps to relieve allergy symptoms such as skin rashes, swelling, hives (itchy, painful eruptions that sting), itching, sneezing, runny or stuffy nose.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rPharmacology\rOlopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies.\r Mode of Action: Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine. Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r Pharmacokinetics: Absorption: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of Olopatadine Nasal Spray. Distribution: The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism: Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles of olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma. Elimination: The plasma elimination half-life of olopatadine is 8 to 12 hours. Olopatadine is mainly eliminated through urinary excretion\rDosage\rEye Drops-\r0.1%: One drop in each affected eye two times per day at an interval of 6 to 8 hours.\r0.2%: One drop in the affected eye once a day.\r0.7%: One drop in each affected eye once a day.\rNasal Spray-\rAdminister Olopatadine Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only.\rAdults and Adolescents 12 years of age and older: Two sprays per nostril twice daily.\\\rChildren 6 to 11 years of age: One spray per nostril twice daily.\rTablet-\rAdults: Take 1 tablet (5 mg of the active ingredient) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease, age or symptoms.\rChildren 7 years old or over: Take 1 tablet (5 mg) at a time, twice daily, in the morning and before going to bed.\rIf you miss a dose, take a dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and follow your regular dosing schedule. You should never take two doses at one time. Do not stop taking this medicine unless your doctor instructs you to do so.\r* রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন'\rAdministration\rHow to use the Nasal Spray-\rShake the bottle gently and remove the dust cover.\rHold the spray with your forefinger and middle finger on either side of the nozzle and your thumb underneath the bottle. Press down until a fine spray appears. If using for the first time or if you have not used it for a week or more, press the nasal applicator several times until a fine moist comes out from the container.\rGently blow the nose to clear the nostrils.\rClose one nostril and carefully insert the nasal applicator into the open nostril. Tilt your head forward slightly and keep the spray upright. Breathe in through your nose and while breathing in, press the white-collar of nasal applicator firmly down once to release a spray.\rBreathe out through your mouth.\rRepeat the above steps in the same/ other nostril for consecutive doses.\rCleaning: The nasal spray should be cleaned at least once a week.

        "description": "Introduction\r Benozol is a medicine used to reduce increased pressure in the eye, in people with glaucoma or ocular hypertension(high pressure in the eye). If the pressure in your eye is too high it can damage your sight. Benozol works by decreasing the amount of fluid inside the eye. Never use Benozol if the seal is broken before you use it for the first time. Wash your hands before using it and shake the bottle well before each use. If you wear contact lenses, make sure you remove them before instilling and wait for at least 15 minutes before putting them back. Do not stop using this medicine without asking your doctor. Otherwise the pressure in your eye will not be controlled and this could damage your sight. The most common side effects are blurred vision and bitter taste in your mouth. Sometimes people experience more general effects such as shortness of breath, dizziness, tiredness or heart palpitations. If your vision is blurred or you have other changes in sight for a time, do not drive until your vision is clear. Do not use this medicine if you have severe kidney problems or are allergic to medicines called sulphonamides.
